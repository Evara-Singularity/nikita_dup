          <strong>LED batten lights
          </strong>
        </a> are lighting fixtures that offer uniform, spot free illumination across different rooms. They are highly
        valued for
        their energy efficiency.
        <strong>LED batten lighting fixtures</strong>
        <em>can help users save as much as 40% on energy bills in comparison to T5 fluorescent tubes</em>. These
        lighting fixtures
        are available in both indoor as well as weatherproof versions. They can be used in combination with LED tubes to
        be used as linear lightings. The latest versions of LED lights have a light weight and therefore they can be set
        up with the help of just two screws.</p>

      <h2 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">How To Select Led Batten Lights?</h2>
      <h3 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Check the lumens of the lighting fixture</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>While selecting batten lights, you are likely to check the wattage, which indicates its brightness</em>. But
        the
        brightness of LEDs is calculated in a different manner. Unlike incandescent lightings, watts do not determine
        the
        brightness of batten lights. Instead, lumen (lm) is used to measure an LED battens brightness. This is the major
        area which you will need to focus upon, once you start looking for LED batten lights.</p>
      <h3>Select the LED batten light according to their colours</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">If you do not prefer a white light with a glare which is offered by LEDs of older
        models, then you should go for newer
        options. Batten lights have a wide range of colours, range from warm yellow white which is similar to colour
        emitted
        by incandescent lightings to a white colour of a brighter shade or bluish white.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Check the package of the batten light for the colour of light which is indicated by its
        temperature on Kelvin scale.
        The ones which have a lower Kelvin produce warm-coloured light. The higher the Kelvin of batten lighting, the
        bluer
        will be the colour of the light it produces.
        <strong>Yellow batten lights have a Kelvin scale of 2700-3000K
        </strong> while
        <strong>the white and blue ones have a Kelvin scale between 3500-4100K and 5000-6500K respectively</strong>.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Colour Rendering Index(CRI)</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>Each batten light comes with a CRI score</em>. Colour Rendering Index refers to the measurement of a
        lighting fixtures
        ability to characterize various colours. Therefore, while selecting a batten light, go for the one with CRI
        which
        denotes the natural colour.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Beam Angle</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Beam angle refers to the degree of width which light produces from a source of light.
        In other words, it is the angle
        between opposing points on beam axis where intensity can go down to 50% to the maximum. LED batten lights come
        with
        a wide variety of beam angles. A wide bead angle floods an area with light is known as a flood light. On the
        other
        hand, a narrow beam angle is called a spot of light, known as a spotlight. Major factors which you will need to
        focus
        on while considering a beam angle for a ceiling light is the light fittings distribution, ceiling light and
        desired
        intensity in certain areas.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">LED chip quality</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>The performance offered by a LED batten light depends on the LED chip</em>. Therefore, you will need to
        focus on
        the type of LED chip that your lighting fixture possesses. Chips of good quality have a higher durability and
        tend
        to depreciate less over time in case of light output as well as light quality. However, you will need to spend a
        higher amount to acquire a LED chip of high quality. Therefore, check the LED chips well before burning.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Durability of the batten light</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Lifespan is another important factor to which you will have to pay attention to.
        <strong>The durability of these lighting fixtures is usually between 30,000-50,000</strong> and therefore
        <strong>can last up to 10-12 years
        </strong>,
        <em>which is far more than fluorescent lightings</em>. The lifespan of these bulbs is also dependent on the heat
        sink
        which is used for drawing heat way from both the LED driver and chip. Dimmability and the presence of a good
        heat
        sink are two major factors that play an important role in extending the lifespan of these sinks.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Dimmability</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">The ambiance of a room is greatly dependent on the amount of light present within it.
        You can control it using dimmable
        batten lights.
        <strong>Illumination can be controlled using dimmable LED batten lights</strong>. The amount of light can be
        turned up or
        down using a dimmer switch. However, the power of the batten light is minimised. Therefore, you will have to
        consider
        while choosing a LED batten light. T8 tubelights have a lifespan of 10-15 years and incur a cost of Rs
        1600-2000.
        <strong>T5 LED tube lights</strong> on the other hand
        <em>incur a cost of Rs 500 but have a lifespan of 3-4 years only</em>.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">There is a visible difference between LED batten lights of high and low quality is that
        the inferior ones have a lower
        quality of power supply, lumen output, and a limited lifespan. This is the major reason why there is a
        significant
        difference in price of LED batten lightings of different models.</p>

    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h2 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">How To Install Led Batten Lights?</h2>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>You will need to assemble the lighting fixture by pressing the two mounting clips into the LED batten</em>.
        You are
        likely to hear a snapping noise. Then mount this lighting fixture to the area where you want to install it,
        using
        two self-tapping flathead screws into each mounting bracket. Then, connect the leader cable to the first LED
        fixtures
        male plague. You are likely to hear two clicking noises. Once you have done that, take out the endcap from each
        side.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Then keep placing the fixtures, but ensure that both male and female plugs are joined.
        Also, attach jumper cables as
        required to work around all types of corners, separations, and complications. Once you have done that, connect
        the
        black and white wires of AC line to leader cables wires of the same colour with the help of wire nuts.
