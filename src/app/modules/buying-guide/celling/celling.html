              offices and commercial establishments, ceiling fans are best suited for use to keep the summer heat at
              bay. In areas that have a temperate climate, multi-speed ceilings fans can be used as a suitable
              replacement for ACs. Majority of the ceiling fan models available in the market can be reversed during
              winters in order to push down the warm air which rise naturally towards the ceiling.</p>
            <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The size of the room decides the length and number of blades
              that a high sped needs to offer the best quality of air circulation. To ensure a safe installation within
              rooms, it is better to take the help of an electrician. Crompton Greaves fans come with different types of
              blades and colors, and go well with the lightings inside rooms. with lights have also been launched in the

              circulation of clean air, remove smoke and excessive heat. These fans also play an instrumental role in
              checking smell and the rise of temperature. These fans operate by using power. The operating procedure
              involves the use of an electric current that passes through the fan’s motor and causes the blades of the
              fan to rotate.</p>

            <h4 class=""></h4>
            <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Blades can be chosen according to the exact area where you will
              be installing a . The rule of thumb that you should follow is to determine the blade span on the basis of
              the room square feet. If the fan that you opt for comes with three blades, then you should measure the
              distance of the fan’s center from the blade tip. On the other hand, it has two or four blades, then you
              will need to measure the distance between the opposing blades. You will need to opt for a blade span
              depending on the size of the room. For instance, if the size of your room is 400 sq. feet, then you will
              need to opt for fans that come with a blade span of 54-72’’.</p>
            <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Once you have a clear idea of the blade span, you will need to
              decide the exact height at which the fan will have to be installed. If the ceiling height is less than
              8’’, then you will need to go for a low profile ceiling fan. If it is more than 9’’, then it would be wise
              on your part to go for a ceiling fan that comes with a down rod. Hanging it at a proper height will ensure
              that neither you nor your family members suffer from any type of head injuries.</p>

              <h4 class="">Exhaust Fans</h4>
              <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">While buying exhaust fans for installation within kitchens,
                you will need to vent the hood outdoors when necessary so that the smoke and odors can easily move out
                from the kitchen. This is the most suitable way to ensure the removal of minute particulate matter. One
                major problem with recirculating fans is that though they can remove odors and particulate matters, they
                often recirculate them back into homes. Another suitable alternative that you can go for is to select a
                range hood keeping in mind its suitability with the exhaust fan and your cooking style. For normal
                cooking equipment (below 60,000 Btu for gas/electric cooktops), 100 CFM is suitable for every 1-foot
                width of your cooking surface.</p>
              <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">If you are using high-performance cooking equipment, then you
                need to go for 1 CFM for every 100 Btu. For instance, 60,000 Btu will require 600 CFM. In case your
                cooktop includes a grill, then an additional 200 CFM to the total that you require. On the other hand,
                if the hood is rated above 300 CFM, then you may need to use a make-up air damper depending on local
                codes.</p>

              <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">While buying table fans, you will need to pay attention to the
                material from which the fans are made. Plastic fans are most suitable as they do not rust unlike the
                ones that are made from stainless steel. Oscillating and rotating fans may develop vibrating noises and
                rattles over a period of time over a period of a few months. One possible solution to the problem is to
                opt for two or more table fans. You can use oscillating fans while oscillation is switched off and
                otherwise leave it as it is, for use on specific occasions. Table fans come with a wide range of designs
                such as tiltable, antique, squat fat etc.</p>

            <h3 class="">Fans Features</h3>
            <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Once you have a clear perception about the type of fans that you want to
              buy, it’s time to concentrate on the features of a fan. Here are some of the important features that you
              will need to pay attention to, while buying a fan online of any type: -</p>
          </div>
          <div class="mar-l-20">
            <h3 class="">Fan Blades</h3>
            <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The position, size, and speed of the blade are deciding factors of the
              effectivity with which a fan rotates and the quality of cooling it offers within a room. The blades of
              non-axial fans usually face in the direction of the airflow. The axial-flow design is used is used in some
              of the most widely used types of fans such as pedestal, ceiling and table fans. Centrifugal fans come with
              blades that are perpendicular to the direction of the air flow. Centrifugal fans come with a high pressure
              which makes them best suited for use in industrial cooling and moisture removal.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="mar-l-20">
            <h3 class="">Power Consumption</h3>
            <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The efficiency of an inverter to a great extent depends on the amount of
              power that it draws. The power drawing capacity of an inverter may vary between 90-50% from full load to
              light load. One thing that you need to find out is whether the efficiency of the inverter is high on
              maximum load or not. Normally, an inverter offers the highest level of efficiency when it is used at
              around 1/3 to 3/4 of its full rating. Small inverters that are used in vehicles can run indefinitely as
              long as the vehicle’s engine is running and there is sufficient battery power. Larger inverters, on the
              other hand, can offer power over extended time periods. All that you need to do is to add more batteries.
            </p>
            <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The power of fans is to a great extent decided by their speed settings
              and unit size. Higher speed settings ensure a cooler temperature within rooms and provide the user with a
              higher level of control. Bigger fans on the other hand can cover large areas. are motor drive. Therefore,
              you will need to verify the size and power of the motor before buying a fan.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="mar-l-20">
            <h3 class="">Fans Operational Noise</h3>
            <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Normally, you would expect your fan to be completely silent when it is
              under use. However, it is often not the case. As a rule of thumb, the higher the price of a fan, the
              lesser will be the noise that it will make. The noise level of a fan (measured in dBs) can be controlled
              if can control its speed. To ensure minimal noise of your fan, you will need to operate it at medium or
              low speed. In case you feel it essential to run the fan at the highest speed throughout the day, then you
              will need to opt for a bigger fan for your room.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="mar-l-20">
            <h3 class="">Fans Oscillation</h3>
            <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The back-and-forth motion of majority of pedestal, tower and table fans
              is oscillation. Apart from moving left to right, a number of these fans also have the ability to move up
              and down. Normally, you can control the oscillation through the use of oscillation through the use of
              remote control or on buttons on the fan chassis. You can also disable oscillation also in case you feel
              that you desire air flow to flow to a particular spot. An oscillating fan blade unit moves from side to
              side. Portable fans that do not come with this feature need to be repositioned in order to offer airflow
              to another area of the room.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="mar-l-20">
            <h3 class="">Safety Features of Fans</h3>
            <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Slip-resistant feet, grounded cord and a ETL safety listing are some of
              the major safety features that a fan needs to have.</p>
            <h4 class="">Cord Length</h4>
            <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Cord length tends to vary according to the model of the fan as well as
              its type. A few cords tend to be short while the long ones may come with a length of around nine feet.
              Fans that are used in offices and commercial establishments usually have long cords. If you want to post
              the fan close to a wall outlet, then the cord length won’t prove to be good issue. On the other hand, if
              the selected location for the fan is not quite close enough, then length of the cord will matter, unless
              you decide to opt for an extension cord.</p>
            <h4 class="">Battery Functions</h4>
            <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Smaller fans such as desk fans sometimes come with the feature of
              optional battery compartment. Battery life to a great extent depends on the fan model. It may be as long
              as 72 hours in a single set of batteries.</p>
            <h3 class="">Additional Features of Fans</h3>
            <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Keeping up with the changing times, fan manufacturers are combining the
              designs of fans with the functionality of radio. The fans that come with this feature can be connected
              with the user’s MP3 player which will enable the person to listen to music from the radio speakers of the
              fan while enjoying the flow of cool air through the different parts of the room.</p>
            <h4 class="">In-built Outlets</h4>
            <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Fans that are mostly used in commercial establishments come with
              in-built outlets which enables the user to connect it with a number of appliances. In the case the area
              where the fan is used requires the need for highly targeted airflow, then these in-built outlets will
              ensure that there is no necessity for multiple extension cords or outlets. However, you will need to
              ensure that there are not too many fans that are connected with each other so as to overload the room’s
              outlet capacity.</p>
            <h4 class="">Remotes and Timers</h4>
            <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Remote controls and programmable times are the normal types of equipment
              that are used in residential fans that are used in homes. Using a remote, you can easily control the speed
              and direction of airflow from any direction. You can easily adjust the airflow by changing conditions with
              the help of a remote. By pre-setting the operating cycle of a timer, you can preset the operating cycle
              for quite a few hours and turn off your fan once the cycle gets over. It will provide you with the much
              needed peace of mind, you won’t have to overspend on your energy bills.</p>
            <h4 class="">Ionizing</h4>
            <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">This feature is applicable in case of tower fans which come with
              in-built ionizers that are highly effective in cleaning air and doing away static electricity. The machine
              emits negative ions which will attach themselves to microscopic particles and allergens. Ionizers filter
              them before the re-circulation of air.</p>
