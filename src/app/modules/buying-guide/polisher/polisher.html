        <em>Opting for a high-quality sander can smoothen your workflow and help you to finish your tasks in time</em>.
        As sanding
        is an activity which you are going to do time &amp; again, it’s wise to opt for a powder sander to save time and
        ensure
        a better finish than what you would have done using your hand. Here are some of the major aspects which you will
        need
        to focus on, while selecting sanders: -</p>
      <h4 class="mar-top">Sand Papers</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <em>Selecting the correct sandpaper is essential as opting for the wrong type of sandpaper can ruin your project
        </em>. They are normally available as sanding discs or in sheets.

        <em>. the number of abrasive particles present per square inch of paper</em>.
        <em>It is normally in the range of 40-600
        </em>.
        <em>The lower the grit, the rougher will be the sandpaper</em>.
        <em>Sandpapers which are very coarse are ideal for stripping paint or varnish</em>. Opting for a medium grit
        between 80-120
        will help you create a smooth surface and remove the imperfections.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">You can also consider opting for very fine-grit sandpaper for removing
        scratches and make the wood ready for staining.
        The sandpaper will then be held on the sander with the help of clamps. A few of them are operated using a
        spring-loaded
        action while others are handled using screwdrivers and levers.</p>

      </h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Sanders create a huge amount of dust and therefore it is essential to find a
        suitable way to get rid of it.
        <em>Dust-collection systems usually comprise dust bags, hoses that are attached to a vacuum and filter canisters
          or hoses</em>.</p>
      <h4 class="mar-top">Convenient Grip</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Continued and extreme vibration can be tiring and cause injury. Therefore,
        it’s important for you to opt for a sander
        which offers a good grip. A soft grip minimises vibration. In case it is possible,
        <em>try to turn on hand-held sanders before you buy to find out how convenient you feel using them</em>.</p>
      <h4 class="mar-top">
        Pad Brakes</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Pad brakes protect the surface from getting gouged on removal of the sander.
      </p>
      <h4 class="mar-top">Trigger Locks
      </h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <em>It helps in locking the sander in the ‘on’ position</em>. Therefore, you won’t have to keep pressing on the
        on button.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">While selecting a polisher, the major aspects that you will need to focus
        upon when selecting a polisher is the brush
        head size, brush speed(rpm) and machine weight apart from accessories. It is ideal for usage in the cleaning
        tasks
        where they are intended to be used.</p>
      <h4 class="mar-top">Speed</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <em>Slower speed rotary buffers are best suited for usage in wet scrubbing, carpet shampooing and for stripping
          floors
        </em>. The ideal suggestion is that
        <em>dirtier your floor, the greater will be the need for deep cleaning
        </em>
        <em>with the help of a slow speed machine</em>. Sticking to a speed of around 300 rpm should be utilised for
        stripping
        floor polish &amp; sanding wooden floors utilising a mesh screen for heavy duty floor scrubbing.
      </p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <strong>Higher speed machines are ideal for buffing, polishing &amp; spray cleaning</strong>. Around 300 rpm
        there is transition
        between floor scrubbing and floor polishing. Therefore, a machine between
        <strong>300-450 rpm is best suited for spray cleaning</strong> where you want a cleaning action to be done on
        the floor but
        need a polished appearance once it’s doe. So, it would be wise on your part to use a neutral cleaner when spray
        cleaning
        on a polished floor to ensure that you don’t need to remove floor polish.</p>
      <h4 class="mar-top">Brush Size
      </h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <em>Polishers of a smaller sized are ideal for usage in restricted areas like toilets, trial rooms etc</em>. On
        the other
        hand, larger machines have a high level of productivity in more open areas like large rooms, halls &amp;
        corridors.
        The
        <strong>brush head size</strong> tends to
        <strong>vary between 10’’ (28 cm) to 20’’ (50 cm)
        </strong> on the
        <em>basis of the manufacturer and model type</em>.</p>
      <h4 class="mar-top">Machine Weight
      </h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <em>A machine with heavy weight which operates at slow speed will ensure a satisfactory level of cleaning over a
          limited
          area</em>. Therefore, slow speed sanders and aggressive pads of darker shades are ideal for removing oil
        polish
        and high level of scrubbing.</p>

      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <em>Wax is a major item which is used in the car waxing process</em>.
        <strong>They are primarily of two types-natural and synthetic waxes.</strong>
        <em>Natural waxes are normally made from carnauba.</em> This type of wax usually lasts for a few months but it
        helps
        in improving a car’s shine to a great extent.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">These waxes do not create a high level of shine like carnauba. But they last
        for a longer time period.
        <em>Synthetic waxes are created either from polymer or acrylic waxes</em>. They have considerable strength for
        protecting
        a vehicle’s paint. Though they lack shine, they don’t leave behind paint streaks.</p>
