          vapour’s
          heating up doesn’t offer a strong beam of light immediately.</p>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">As the bulb takes longer than others to acquire full strength, they are not
          ideal for usage with motion sensor
          lights and other fixtures which mostly used for security purpose. As compared to other types of bulbs, the
          light
          produced from sodium vapour bulbs have yellower shade as compared to others. Therefore, you will need to keep

        electricity
        costs by using a
        <em>commercial, outdoor or home depot LED flood light</em>. Therefore, it is a highly energy-friendly light
        source. Normal
        flood lights can often be turned on for around 12 hours for seven days in a week. So, you can replace a normal
        1500
        Watt halogen floodlight which offers a lumen output of around 33000 Lm. You can replace
        <em>normal flood light bulbs</em> with
        <em>cost effective LED flood lights</em> with 400 Watt and a lumen output of 40000 Lm. Therefore, you can make
        high savings

          <em> which you need to determine the flood light location within your residence</em>.
          <strong>First and foremost</strong>, the
          <strong>outdoor flood lighting fixture</strong> needs to be placed in a way so that they produce bright light
          on the targeted
          area without producing too much glare. So, to ensure that the light bulbs do not produce too much light, mount
          the bulbs in the downward position at an angle of 22 degrees.
          <strong>Second</strong>,
          <em>make sure that the flood light is placed at a position from where it isn’t pointed towards a neighbour’s
            apartment
          </em>.
          <strong>Last but not the least</strong>,
          <em>make sure that the lights are positioned at a minimum 9 feet from ground to check touching or
            tampering</em>.

          They
          are used in combination with infrared sensors. They usually have a 180-degree range of motion and has the
          capacity
          to pick up people and objects which are located up to a distance of 75 feet. Depending on the sensor, the
          light
          remains active for around 1-10 minutes before being getting automatically shut off. Therefore,
          <em>it offers a high level of safety and ensures that there is no wastage of energy in case you forget to tur
            it off</em>.
          But before you opt for a flood light which is equipped with motion sensor, be sure whether you need it or not

          <strong>Colour Quality - </strong>The
          <strong>Colour Rendering Index (CRI)</strong> is used for measuring colour quality. CRI is used to find out
          the accuracy
          with which colours are represented under different bulbs. CRI ratings range between 1-100.
          <em>A CRI score of 100 means that the bulb produces a broad spectrum of colours
          </em>. Fluorescent bulbs have a CRI of 70. Halogens on the other hand have a very high ranking, in the upper
          90’s
          to 100. LEDs have a CRI in the range of 70-90. These differentiations exist because of differences in the
          production
          process.
          <em>If you are aware that fluorescent light quality is close to 70 and sunlight is close to 100</em>, you can
          use these
          figures and familiarity of those lights to find out how the objects will appear under your preferred
          floodlight.
          But make sure that you have a CRI number to do so.

          <strong>Colour Temperature - </strong>
          <em>Colour temperature is the label that is given to the colour of light produced by a bulb.</em> Normally,
          you will
          come across ‘
          <strong>’bright’’</strong>,
          <strong>‘’cool’’</strong>,
          <strong>‘’natural”</strong>,
          <strong>‘’warm’’</strong> or
          <strong>‘’daylight’’</strong> labels on the packages. The ones that come with ‘’cool’’ label are normally
          placed at the
          colour spectrum’s blue end which makes them brighter and whiter to naked eye. The ones that are labelled
          ‘’warm’’
          offer a yellowish colour to the eyes. Colour temperature is normally measured in Kelvins (K). Kelvins usually
          range
          between 2000-8000K.
          <em>Halogens and lighting fixtures which have a warm white light label of have colour temperature of 3000K.
            Cool white
            lights have a colour temperature between 3100-45000 K</em>.
          <em>Normally warm bulbs are utilised in bedrooms and living areas since they help in creating a warm ambience.
            Cool
            lights are widely used in garages and offices.</em>

          <strong>Usage - </strong>The manner where you use the lights is the major factor you need to focus on when
          selecting an
          LED flood light.
          <em>White coloured floodlights are ideal for use in a garage and lamp posts.
          </em> Most of the LED floodlights offer light in one direction which makes them suitable for use as downlights
          and overhead lights. In case you are looking for a bulb which offers a wider band of light like the one which
          is
          used in floor or table lamps. Similarly, if you intend to dim your lights, you will need to look for LEDs that
          are dimmable flood lighting.
