        <i>A <strong>
            <a [routerLink]="['/power-tools/drills/114160000']">drilling machine</a></strong> is a tool which is widely
          used by technicians in order to create holes in different types
          of surfaces such as wood, aluminum, steel and concrete.</i> Drill machines are widely used in the construction
        industry and also by workshop based owners in masonry, marble cutting etc. They can also be used in a number of
        DIY
        projects. These devices are motor driven and come with an end cutting tool which is used for drilling through
        these
        surfaces.</p>
      <p class="pad-lr-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-tb-5">Drilling machines rotate and apply a hammering action while
        drilling. Once you switch to the impact or hammer mode,
        the drill bit will vibrate and push forward as rapidly as it turns backward. This makes the tools suitable for
        creating
        holes within a short period of time, even through hard walls of concrete. These power tools are also highly
        useful
        for creating channels in a wall in order to conceal wires and cables. Drilling machines are also
        <i>suitable for use in specific industrial applications such as welding. They are used across different
          industries such
          as iron, steel, metallurgy, oil & gas etc.</i>

      <p class="pad-lr-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Drills which come with a hammer function are very useful for
        technicians. They offer them with the required power necessary
        in the case of applications such as masonry and building demolition projects. Therefore, hammer drills are
        suitable
        for use in different types of indoor as well as outdoor applications. Moglix offers hammer drills online from
        eminent
        brands such as Bosch, Black & Decker, Cumi, Dewalt, Stanley, Eastman etc. As compared to drill driver, a heavy
        duty
        option is not suitable to use in woodworking. Their extra power increases the danger of damaging timber. These
        drills
        make a loud noise. Therefore, you should wear ear plugs while using them. A rotary drill with a voltage of
        around
        350W is the most viable option if you are looking for a tool specifically for woodworking purpose. The drilling
        machine
        prices at Moglix have been kept within a competitive range to suit the budget of technicians, plumbers,
        electricians,
        carpenters as well as home based users.</p>

          drill which has the ability to function multiple functions such as screw driving,
          hammering, impact driving etc. You can set this drill in a way similar to a hammer drill for drilling holes
          within
          tough surfaces. This type of drills can also be used as drill driver, both for drilling holes and also for
          driving
          screws. Because of their versatile feature, rotary drills are used in a wide range of industrial as well as
          workshop
          based applications. The rotary drills which are available online at Moglix have been created by brands such as
          Bosch, Dewalt, Eastman, Hitachi, Makita etc.</p>

          <i>This type of drills come with an impact mechanism which offers a high torque as well as high impact
            force.</i>
          So, it is highly effective while driving screws into surfaces such as wood and metal. This mechanism ensures
          a high level of safety without any type of shrinking. The <strong> <a

          offers have been created
          by manufacturers such as
          <b>Bosch, Cumi, Dewalt, Eastman, Hitachi </b>etc.</p>
        <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">
          <i>Impact drills are best suited for use in cabinet makers and are ideal for use in DIY projects.</i> They
          have
          the ability to drive screws with a higher level of frequency as compared to other drills.
          <b>Impact drills</b> are very strong and offer good control. They can also be used for renovation projects at
          home.
          <i>Unlike the regular chuck bits, impact drills come with a hexagonal socket.</i> It is always wise to use ear
          protection
          and safety googles while using such a drill.
          <i>One thing that you should remember is that you cannot use an impact drill instead of a hammer drill.</i>
          This
          because both these drills make use of different drill bits.</p>

          woodworking. These drills have a cast iron base and usually, come with a work table which offers a high level
          of stability and precision in drilling. New models of bench drills come with a depth adjustment system which
          makes them viable for users to have complete depth control. They come with an adjustable depth stop that makes
          sure that the measurements taken are perfect and repetitive drilling can be done. The bench drills available

        <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">A drill press is a type of tool which is used to drill or expand a
          cylindrical hole within a workpiece. Though
          mainly used for drilling purpose, it is also suitable for use in applications such as counter boring, tapping,
          reaming and countersinking. Drill presses are highly valued by carpenters for their proficiency in drilling
          precise
          holes with the exact widths, angles and depths that a design requires. Drill presses come with a depth-stop
          which
          automatically prevents it from sinking too deep within a wooden piece. The collection of drill presses at
          Moglix
          includes products which have been sourced from brands like Hitachi, Groz, Ferm etc.</p>

          They are widely used in the construction
          industry in order to create holes in pipes, manholes etc. Diamond drills are highly effective in creating
          holes
          on surfaces such as glass, gemstone, ceramic, porcelain, tiles, hardwood etc. The smaller versions of these
          drills
          are also widely used in jewelry making. However, diamond drill bits are not suitable for use on metal and soft
          wood surfaces. The diamond drills offered online by Moglix have been produced by brands such as Makita,

        <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">
          <strong>Corded Drilling Machines</strong> - This type of drilling machines is ideal for people who have more
          experience
          in doing heavy work. They offer extra power and torque, unlike their cordless counterparts. The corded
          drilling
          machines are suitable for use on a day to day basis in workshops and factory settings. They also come with
          greater
          features as compared to cordless models. Using a corded drill, you won’t be stuck in the middle of any
          project.
          They are widely used in heavy-duty jobs like masonry.</p>

              Drilling Machines</a></strong> - Cordless drills are ideal for DIY projects. A cordless power drill which
          comes with a rechargeable battery would be a viable option. Though they are less powerful as compared to
          corded
          drills, these tools are lightweight, user-friendly and safe to use. For time-consuming jobs, you should also
          use a second battery or drill that comes with a quick change function. This will ensure that you don’t have to
          wait for the battery to get recharged.</p>
        <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Compared to corded drills, cordless drills have greater flexibility and are
          more convenient to use. They can be
          used in places which are not easily accessible such as ladders, trees etc. So, they are suitable for use by
          home-based
          users.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h3 class="no-margin mar-t-15 mar-b-15">What Type of Batteries Do Drilling Machines Have?</h3>
      <p class="lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Normal cordless drills use nickel cadmium (NiCd or NiCad) and
        Lithium-ion(Li-ion) batteries. Li-ion batteries are
        smaller and lightweight as compared to NiCd batteries with the same voltage. They can hold a charge for many
        months
        even when they are not in use. Therefore, they are widely used in home based projects. Li-ion batteries are also
        free from toxic cadmium which can percolate into ground water in case NiCd batteries are thrown into the trash
        rather than being recycled. However, lack of know-how to use li-ion batteries could cause death. Moreover, many
        lithium batteries cannot be easily replaced since they are highly expensive.</p>
