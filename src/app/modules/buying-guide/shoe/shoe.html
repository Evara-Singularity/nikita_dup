            are best suited for people who work in airports, nuclear power plants or as security personnel.</p>
          <p class="f-size-13 lh-22"><strong>Alloy Toe:</strong> It is much lighter than a steel toe but is equally
            strong. A slight reduction in boot weight will minimize food fatigue and make factories, plants and

            toe caps offer better clues as
            compared to shoes with composite material toecaps. For instance, if a heavy object falls on a steel toe
            footwear, it can be dented and won't spring back. The footwear will need to be replaced under these
            circumstances. In contrast, composite material shoes may be greatly damaged but still retain their form.
          </li>
          <li class="pad-tb-5 f-size-12">Experts recommend industrial workers to opt for impact resistant footwear. If
            the shoes get tattered and
            worn over a period of time, and the toes are visible through the sides, the steel toe can be visible through
            leather and will need to be replaced. The same rule of thumb applies to slip-resistant safety shoes. If the
            outsole shows any visible signs of wear out, the shoe is likely to be passed it's prime.

          <li class="pad-tb-5 f-size-12">But how to take the best care of safety footwear on a regular basis? To ensure
            that your pair remains in the
            best working condition, it is essential to keep the footwear clean, wash and dry feet thoroughly and change
            socks on a daily basis. Make it a point to polish full grain leather footwear and treat it with a leather
            preservative.
          </li>
          <li class="pad-tb-5 f-size-12">In the case of shoes made from brush suede and nubuck leathers, applying
            waterproofer would be a good idea.
            Clean the soles by brushing and washing for removal of contaminants. However, keep one thing in mind. Avoid
            using solvents for cleaning the footwear. It should not be forced dried. They are best suitable to kept in a
            cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
          </li>
          <li class="pad-tb-5 f-size-12">To protect the pair from water damage, remove excess water using a dry cloth.
            They should be dried in a
            well-ventilated area, which doesn't have access to do direct access to sunlight. Check the footwear for
            external damage before and after each use. If there are cracks or breaks in leather, you will need to
            replace
            it. Unauthorised alterations should be avoided as they alter the effectiveness of the shoe.

        <h3>Size Guide</h3>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">The size of your feet tends to change at various stages of your life. To ensure that
          you get a shoe of the most
          appropriate fit, you can take a measurement of your feet. To do so, you will need to place your feet on a
          blank
          paper on a hard floor. Then, stand on top of it, wearing a sock with medium thickness holding a pencil which
          is
          90º and create a mark on your heel's end.</p>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-b-30">Put another mark on your longer toe's tip. To have a good idea of your size,
          measure this mark. In case, your
          measure is between two sizes or the measurement of one foot is more than that of another, go for a pair with a
          larger size.</p>
