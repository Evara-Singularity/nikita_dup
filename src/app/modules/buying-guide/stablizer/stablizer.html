      <h3 class="">What is a Stabilizer?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">A stabilizer is a vital component which is used to check serious damages to
        electrical appliances such as ACs, TVs, refrigerators etc. They are highly effective in checking fluctuations in
        voltage and check damages caused by the issue and in turn enhance the durability of your electrical appliances.
        A stabilizer with the latest design and adherence to existing industrial specifications can protect your
        appliances from voltage fluctuations over a long span of time.</p>

      <h3 class="">What is The Main Usage of a Stabilizer? How Does It Protect Electrical Appliances?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Stabilizers (also known as Automatic and Safe Voltage Regulators) are static
        devises that are used for detecting fluctuations in utility and through internal regulation deliver a consistent
        range of output voltage. Once the home voltage stabilizer finds that your voltage is low, it will stabilize it
        and boost it to the required level and feed the equipment which it is connecting to. This happens inversely for
        a high voltage in the utility line. The stabilizers ensure efficient availability of voltage with the help of an
        electronic circuitry that change the required taps of an inbuilt auto transformer using high quality
        electromagnetic relay to produce the necessary voltage.</p>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">In case the voltage supplied doesn’t fall within the range, in that case a
        mechanism changes the required transformer tap, bringing the voltage supply within a secure range. Therefore,
        the stabilizer acts as a bulwark between your electronic appliance and utility for round the clock tracking and
        verification of fluctuations in voltage that are visible in the utility. It will make sure that your appliance
        has access to a consistent voltage range as it puts its input for a smooth operation and ensures a long life
        span.</p>

      <h3 class="">How to Select a Right Sized Automatic Stabilizer for Home Use?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">
        Choosing a suitable stabilizer is essential to ensure the smooth functioning of your appliances. The major areas
        that you will need to pay attention to is nature, power consumption range of the appliance and the level of
        voltage fluctuations that take place in the locality. To ensure a high level of safety for the equipment to be
        protected, you need to check the rating of the equipment that requires protection. Most of the ratings are
        usually mentioned as Amps, KVA and KW. Therefore, you will need to have some basic idea about nominal line
        voltage and frequency.

        Here are some tips that you can use to select a stabilizer: -
      </p>
      <ul class="pad-t-20 majorpoints">
        <li>
          <p class="f-size-12 lh-24 "><b>Verify the voltage, current and power ratings of the device</b>You can find the
            necessary information on the specification sticker close to the power socket. In case they are not
            available, you can take the help of a user manual. The normal Indian standard voltage is 230VAC and 50 Hz.
          </p>

          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="f-size-12 lh-24">In order<b>to acquire maximum power, multiply ‘’230x Max rated current’</b>of all
            appliances that you are going to connect with the stabilizer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="f-size-12 lh-24 "><b>Add around 20% safety margin while to determine a stabilizer rating</b>of all
            appliances that you are going to connect with the stabilizer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="f-size-12 lh-24 "><b> Also make it a point to consider the surge current</b>that flows once you
            switch on the device.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="f-size-12 lh-24 ">If the voltage stabilizer has a rating in watts, also <b>accept a power factor of
              0.8(W=V*A*pf)</b></p>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">

      <p class="f-size-12 lh-24">
        The vital thing that you need to know is the nature of load which you are connecting to your stabilizer. Make it
        a point to jot down the power (or Watts) for appliances which will be connected to it. The total sum of power
        consumption (Watts) will give you an indication of the load on the stabilizer in watts.
      </p>
      <p class="f-size-12 lh-24">
        However, majority of automatic stabilizers sizes are in VA (Volt Ampere) or kVA (kilo Volt Ampere that is equal
        to 1000 Volt Ampere). Though some measurements may be essential to get actual VA (or Volt Ampere) from Watts(W),
        to have an estimate, you can increase the Watts value by 20% in order to get a clear VA size that you need.

        So, for instance if the total Watts connected to the stabilizer you have is 1000, then you can for a model which
        has a 1200 VA or 1.2 Kva. (Please keep in in mind that 20% works only for stabilizers used in homes and is not
        suitable for use in industries with poor power factor). Normally, a stabilizer is available with different
        working ranges (working range refers to the voltage range where the stabilizer operates the input utility
        voltage and offers a suitable output voltage). Also take into account the stabilizer that suits the voltage
        fluctuations in your neighborhood.
