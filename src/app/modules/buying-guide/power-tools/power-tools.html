        <h3 class="f-size-22">What are Power Tools?</h3>
        <p class="  lh-26 f-12 pad-b-5">Power tools are equipment which make use of compressed air, combustion or
          electricity. They help users to complete
          numerous tasks which cannot be easily completed using traditional tools. They have proven to be very useful in
          applications where manual labour using hand tools may not produce the best results. Power tools operate by
          using
          electricity, combustion or compressed air which enables them to function smoothly. Due to their numerous
          features
          and effectiveness, power tools are commonly used in home based applications and industries like construction,
          manufacturing
          etc.</p>

        <h3 class="f-size-22">Classification of Power Tools</h3>
        <p class="  lh-26 f-12 pad-b-5">Power tools can be classified in more than ways. In terms of portability, they
          can be classified as stationary or
          portable. Stationary power tools are big equipment that are not very mobile and need to be fastened to a
          stationary
          object for smooth functioning. In contrast, portable power tools can be smoothly carried from place to place,
          and
          can easily be carried by hands.</p>

            electric
            motor or internal combustion. Sanders play a major role in smoothing a surface by moving another rough
            surface
            over their top. Sanders are of a large variety and include disk sanders, belt sanders, mouse sanders and
            drum
            sanders.</p>
          <p class="  lh-26 f-12 pad-b-5">Saws are basically used for cutting purpose and have a blade or band which
            moves with great speed, thereby offering
            sufficient cutting power. Some of the most commonly used types of saws include bands, radial arms, and
            tables.
            Drills utilize a motor for turning. As a result, they help in the fast cutting of circular holes. Major
            types
            of drills include stationary drill press and portable cordless drills. Other examples of portable power
            tools
            include power wrenches and power hammers. Compared to other power tools, they are lighter and smaller. This
            makes them suitable for use by electricians and professionals in building maintenance.</p>

        <h3 class="f-size-22 mar-tb-30">How to Choose power tools?</h3>
        <h2 class="f-size-22 mar-t-15">Design &amp; Convenience</h2>
        <p class="  lh-26 f-12 pad-b-5">Design and convenience are major factors that you should focus on while
          selecting a power tool. Drill designs are
          normally of two types -T-handles comes with a handle near the middle of the drill body and a pistol grip
          design
          that has a handle at the rear of the drill. The T-handle is considered a better option for long hours of work
          since
          it helps in minimizing wrist fatigue. On the other hand, drills with pistol grip design can be stored easily
          and
          utilized for non-professional purpose.</p>

        <h2 class="f-size-22 mar-t-15">Specifications &amp; Purpose</h2>
        <p class="  lh-26 f-12 pad-b-5">To make the best use of power tools, you need to go for accessories which are
          available in the box. The presence
          of an adjustable side handle, will, for example, help you in drilling stability and control. The accessories
          that
          you can focus on include cases, chargers, spare batteries etc. Variable speed clutch can make it easier for
          you
          to drill a wide range of materials utilizing various bits. Harder objects need slow speed and high torque
          while
          softer materials require low torque and high speeds. Speed is controlled by the trigger. Torque setting can be
          altered with the help of a drill clutch.</p>
        <p class="  lh-26 f-12 pad-b-5">While selecting demolition hammers, hardness of concrete is an important aspect
          that you will need to pay attention
          to. It will give you a clear idea about your exact power requirements. Also, focus the type of work you will
          be
          doing using the tool. If you are chipping, then a demolition hammer will serve your purpose. As for chipping
          and
          drilling, a combination hammer is a better option.</p>

        <h2 class="f-size-22 mar-t-15">Power &amp; Wattage</h2>
        <p class="  lh-26 f-12 pad-b-5">Weight and voltage ratings: Voltage ratings between 4-8 volts are considered
          suitable for light duty work. However,
          power tools with 12 to 18 volts are considered most suitable for home applications. High powered models are
          best
          suitable for use in heavy duty work. However, they have extra weight and require a bigger battery for
          operating.</p>

        <h2 class="f-size-22 mar-t-15">Capacity</h2>
        <p class="  lh-26 f-12 pad-b-5">Capacity is another important aspect that you need to focus on while selecting a
          power tool. Drills up to 7 mm capacity
          are considered suitable for light work while 10mm is best suited for home applications. The ones which are 13
          mm
          and above are best suited for heavy duty work and can be used in numerous applications. The ones which come
          with
          higher voltage have more power. As a result, you will have more torque while mitre sawing or driving saws and
          greater
          speed for sanding and jigsawing.</p>

        <h3 class="f-size-22">Maintenance &amp; Storage Tips</h3>
        <h2 class="f-size-22 mar-t-15">Keep them Clean</h2>
        <p class="  lh-26 f-12 pad-b-5">As in the case of any other tool, dust and debris can, to a great extent, reduce
          the durability of a power tool. First
          and foremost, you need to do away small particles from their air vents and cases so that they don't stick to
          any
          part of the equipment. Alcohol will prove to be effective in stain removal from the casing.</p>
        <h2 class="f-size-22 mar-t-15">Wipe it before and after Use</h2>
        <p class="  lh-26 f-12 pad-b-5">Each time you use a power tool, wipe it with the help of a microfiber cloth. To
          remove dust and minute particles sticking
          to it by cleaning air vents using a small paint brush. The brush should not be kept close to power tools. You
          can
          also use a cloth that is a bit damp as an alternative. Similarly, after use, we should wipe off all the dust
          particles
          from the power tool. If not cleaned regularly, these particles can be hardened by the heat given out by the
          tool
          which can have an adverse impact on its durability.</p>
        <h2 class="f-size-22 mar-t-15">Follow the Manual</h2>
        <p class="  lh-26 f-12 pad-b-5">Tools with moving parts in their exterior require maintenance to run smoothly on
          a regular basis. Make it a point to
          go through a power tool manual to find out the exact type of lubricants that are suitable for use on external
          moving
          parts. As in the case of cordless tools, battery performance is of primary concern. A battery needs to be
          charged
          well each time they are used. Ensure that the battery doesn't run out of power. Cordless batteries that are
          charged
          regularly have a long life span. They need be kept dry and if you find that it has become too hot, stop
          working and
          allow it to cool down.</p>
        <h2 class="f-size-22 mar-t-15">Store it well</h2>
        <p class="  lh-26 f-12 pad-b-5">Storage is an important aspect that you cannot afford to ignore. There's no
          point in cleaning a tool if it is stored
          in a dirty place. They should not be stored at the ground level as the area has a lot of dust. To keep power
          tools
          in a good working condition, they need to be stored in a cool, dry phrase. Moisture causes a considerable
          amount
          of damage to power tools. Moisture causes rusting which can shorten their lifespan. Too much of moisture can
          also
          cause a short circuit within a power tool and damage it.</p>
        <p class="  lh-26 f-12 pad-b-5">They need to be stored in areas with sub-zero temperatures. While storing them
          during the winter, you need to ensure
          that they don't freeze. The best place to store them is the basement, which tends to be warmer than the
          garage.</p>
        <h2 class="f-size-22 mar-t-15">Safety Tips</h2>
        <p class="  lh-26 f-12 pad-b-5">Accidents never come with warnings. To avoid serious accidents, make sure that
          you don’t carry a tool using the cord
          or hose. The hose/cord should not be disconnected. The cords and hoses need to be kept far from heat, oil and
          sharp
          edges. They need to be disconnected when not in use. Cleaning and servicing are must while changing the
          accessories.
          Make sure that there are no accidental starts. Don’t hold fingers on switch button while you carry the
          plugged-in
          tool.</p>
