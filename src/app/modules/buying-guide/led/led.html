      <h3 class="f-size-18">What is An LED light?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED (Light Emitting Diodes) are a unique type of electronic lighting
        equipment. They are different from the normal lighting sources that you may come across such as halogen lamps.
        They have a higher durability, consume much lesser amount of energy and produce a minimal amount of heat. They
        are not produced from fragile elements like glass tubes and are considered more safe as they do not contain any
        mercury or lead. They are usually available with common light fittings like MR16 and B22.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18">How Much Power Do LEDs Consume?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED bulbs consume around 90% less energy as compared to incandescent or
        halogen bulbs which have the same brightness. The former are more energy efficient in converting electricity
        into light and are measured in lumens.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18">What is The Life Span of LED Bulbs?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">One of the major benefits of LED usage is their long life span because of
        efficient thermal management. LED bulbs can remove heat through their heat sinks which helps in enhancing their
        life span through slowdown in lumen depreciation. An LED lighting source with excellent thermal management can
        have a life span of 50,000 hours. Be careful from retailers who make exaggerated claims about the durability of
        their products.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-7 pad-l-30">
        <h4 class="f-size-18">Types of LED Lights</h4>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Miniature LEDs: They normally come with a predefined size and shape.
          This enables them to comply with a wide range of circuit boards. Most of the miniature LEDs that you would
          come across are available in 5V and 12V range. These lighting sources come with a ready to fit mode due to
          which they can be installed in circuit boards directly. They normally do not require support of heat sinks.
        </p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED Bulbs: LED bulbs consume a limited amount of power and are easy
          to install and use. LED bulbs can turn on within a short span of time and have a longer life span as compared
          to the normal automotive bulbs that you would come across. As in case of normal bulbs, LED light bulbs fit
          per-existing sockets.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED Strips: LED Strip lights come with high powered LEDs which are
          placed on super thin flexible circuit boards with adhesive coating on their back. LED strip lights can be used
          in a variety of ways such as accent lighting on vehicles, kitchen lighting as well as for general lighting
          within rooms.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED Down-lights: These lighting sources can be installed easily and
          consume minimal amount of energy as compared to halogen globes. But they produce the same amount of light as
          in case of the former. These lights have a long life span and can produce photons (light energy) when electric
          current passes through it. These lighting sources are also resistant to voltage spikes. They can be turned on
          and off every now and then without any negative impact on their life span. They are free from mercury and do
          not have any adverse impact on the environment and have a lower temperature as compared to halogen lighting
          sources. LED down-lights do not come with gas filled globes and as a result, are not exposed to the dangers of
          breakage.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">These lights are designed using a cold light source. They can be
          easily transported and installed. They are vibration resistant as well. They do not contain any mercury which
          is detrimental to the environment. The parts of these lighting equipment can be disassembled and recycled
          easily. They do not emit infrared light. These lights power up within a short span of time as compared to high
          pressure sodium lamps.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED Spotlights: These lighting sources are eco-friendly and have
          long durability. They produce a limited amount of infrared light and do not make UV emissions. As a result,
          they are widely used in heat sensitive items. They can be effective in reducing power consumption and involve
          minimum maintenance costs.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED Footlights: These lights are mostly used in staircases,
          passages, driveways etc. Produced from the best quality of aluminum, they are best suited for offering
          illumination to pathways, landscapes and staircases. normally available in various grades like rectangle,
          square and vertical. LED footlights come in different colors such red, blue, cool white, green, warm white and
          neutral white.
        </p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED Floodlights: LED floodlights offer a high quality of
          illumination and are energy efficient. They come with non-burying cables and have a long durability. They are
          ideal for lighting stadiums, playgrounds, parks etc. These lighting sources are eco-friendly and are widely
          appreciate for their high performance.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED Street Lights: These lighting sources emit directional light and
          are best suited for directing lighting in a particular direction. Unlike traditional sources of lighting, they
          can be dimmed and offer users with more flexibility to control the amount of illumination.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED Garden Lights: LED Garden lights are mostly used for
          illuminating gardens, parks and patios</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Decorative Lights: Decorative lights are highly energy efficient and
          adds sparkle within rooms. Available in numerous shapes, sizes & styles, the most common decorative lights
          include chandeliers, sconces & pendants. At Moglix, we deal in a wide range of LED decoration lights for home
          decor. Wall sconces are ideal for adding a bit of sparkle within small areas of the room. They are usually
          used in place of vanity bar of lights in the bathroom. Pendants on the other hand are used as task lighting
          solutions. The chandeliars are used for ambient lighting and for decorations during festive occasions such as
          Diwali and Christmas.</p>

      <h3 class="f-size-18">What is The Brightness of LED Lights?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Brightness of LED lighting equipment are measured in lumens(Lm). The higher
        the amount of lumens, the brighter will the light produced. Though LED lights use very light wattage, they emit
        the equal amount of brightness as traditional lighting equipment do. Keeping the convenience of users in mind,
        most retailers quote an equivalent incandescent bulb’s wattage so that the former can replace their existing
        equipment and get the same amount of brightness.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18">Color Temperature</h3>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED Bulbs emit white light in different shades such as bright white in bright
        tined fluorescent tubes, soft white, similar yellow shades incandescent light and bright light mostly for use in
        security. Your lighting needs will decide the exact color and brightness of the bulbs that you will use. CRI
        (Color Rendering Index) is used for measuring the closeness in color of a bulb to incandescent. The pattern and
        shade of light is measured in Kelvin, a type of temperature rating.</p>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The higher the K temperature of a bulb, the brighter will the light it
        produces. LED bulbs offer satisfactory color rendering, i.e. a bulb’s ability to show the actual color of
        objects. It is measured on a scale between zero to 100, of which 100 is best. LEDs normally provide 85 in this
        scale. Apart from white hues, LED lighting bulbs are available in other colors also. One notable feature of LED
        lights is that you can adjust the light to the full range of colors.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18">Choose According to Brightness and Energy Efficiency</h3>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Opt for bulbs that come with high lumens and low wattage for ensuring
        substantial energy savings. Divide lumens by wattage to find out best brightness to energy usage ratio.
      </p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18">Choose According to Shape</h3>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Spotlights are most suitable for use for track lighting. Flood lights are
        ideal for use as outdoor and recessed lights. LED candles can be used as wall sconces as well as decorative
        fixtures.
      </p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18"> Choose According to Color Rendering Index(CRI)</h3>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">CRI is used for measuring a light bulb’s capacity to show the colors of items
        in its neighborhood with the help of bright natural light. A CRI of 100 indicates precise color appearance. On
        the other hand, a poor color rendering could be rated zero or even lesser. An LED lighting source with high CRI
        will show its surroundings in same colors that you would view in bright sunlight. In case of poor CRI, you could
        come across red or blue tone. Most of the LED bulbs that are available in the market have a CRI of 80-90. 90 or
        above ratings are regarded as excellent. In case of domestic use, precise color rendering isn’t essential and a
        rating of 80 is considered OK.
      </p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18">Choose According to Bulb Shapes</h3>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED bulbs are of different shapes. A shaped bulbs are of two types-A19 and
        A15. The latter is smaller and is used in bath bars, chandeliers and fridges. The GU-10 base is normally used
        for track lighting and ceiling fans. The E-26 or E-27 medium base is one of the most widely used LED bulbs. The
        LED bulbs with E-39 and E-40 Mogul base are made from ceramic and are mostly used in torchiere lamps. The E12
        candelabra base is normally found in chandeliers and wall sconces. They have a blunt tip on the top and a flame
        tip.
      </p>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">B shaped bulbs are also called Candelabra light bulbs. They come with a bulged
        base which tapers to an either rounded or pointed tip. PAR light bulbs make use of either reflective surface or
        parabolic mirror to focus illumination. In case of LED bulbs, the PAR designation is used to denote the shape
        since most of them don’t have a reflective lower surface because of their directive nature. Some of the most
        common bulbs of this type include PAR20, PAR30, PAR38 and PAR42. They come with different beam angles and are
        mostly used in spot and flood lamps.</p>

      <h3 class="f-size-18">Are LED Lights Cost Effective?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Be it a residential property or office, lighting consumes a significant amount
        of the total power consumption. By opting for LED, you can save a sizable amount of money because most of these
        lighting sources have low wattage. As LED lights last for a long time period, there is no need to replace them.
        Neither would they incur heavy maintenance costs. As a result, you can save a sizeable amount of money on your
        energy bills.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h3 class="f-size-18">How are LED Lights Environment-Friendly?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED lights help in minimizing carbon emissions. Once an existing CFL or
        incandescent bulb is replaced, you can reduce the amount of CO2 being released in the air. The main reason
        behind this is the fact that LED lights use lesser energy than factories and power plants by burning fossil
        fuels. They do not waste energy like incandescent bulbs do to offer limited light. The excess energy is
        converted into heat and released into the environment.</p>

      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED lights do not contain harmful metals. Lead and mercury are considered as
        some of the most toxic metals. Normal CFL, halogen and incandescent bulbs contain these metals. Rejecting these
        bulbs or throwing them in landfills can cause the lead and mercury to mix with water or air. LEDs do not contain
        these harmful metals.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h3 class="f-size-18">Do LED Bulbs Fit Existing Settings?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED bulbs are retrofit and are designed in a manner to ensure that they fit
        into existing light fittings and be utilized as a suitable replacement. While fitting them in bathrooms, you
        will need to ensure that they are waterproof and fire rated and hold the IP65 configuration and complies with
        important building regulations related to bathrooms.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h3 class="f-size-18">What Colors of LED Lights are Available?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The LED light output is normally of three colors-warm white, cool white and
        daylight. Warm white is normally used in homes and is the usual color opted as a replacement for halogen bulbs.
        Cool white is cooler and is normally used in fluorescent tubes in offices and retail outlets. The daylight color
        produces very warm light, and has a shade of blue in it. It offers the best color of lighting.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h3 class="f-size-18">Can LED Lights Operate Outdoors or Under Cold Temperature?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-26 f-size-12 pad-b-5">LED lights are best suited for use in cold, low outdoor temperature settings.
        This is not the case with CFL bulbs. They are also highly durable and prepared from sturdy components which can
        tolerate inhospitable weather conditions. As LEDs are shock resistant and can survive external and vibrational
        impacts, they are best suited for use in outdoor lighting systems.</p>
