      <p class="lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">To maintain the efficiency of your office staff, you need to keep special
        attention to the office supplies that we
        procure. Here are some steps that you can adapt in order to select
        <a [routerLink]="['/office-supplies/214000000']">office supplies</a>: -</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-17 pad-b-15 text-500">Printers</h3>
      <p class="lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The initial question all printer buyers need to tackle come down to a simple
        matter of what and how much you plan to
        print. Colour inkjet printers are the most widely used in the market simply because they can print almost
        anything
        from pie charts, essays or glossy photos. However, the texts printed by them are not always as sharp as that of
        a
        laser printer. They are usually slower and in some cases they cost more to keep it running.
      </p>
      <p class="lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">
        <strong>Laser printers</strong> on the other hand dominate offices as they can quick a large volumes of text
        quickly, reliably
        and are comparatively cheap. Moreover, they look sharper than text from an inkjet, laser printouts won’ run when
        they get weight. At present, colour lasers have become more affordable. But since costs of replacement are
        comparatively
        high often which makes them a bad option for domestic use.</p>
      <h4 class="mar-top">Cartridges</h4>
      <p class="lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The
        <a class="text-blue" [routerLink]="['/office-supplies/computer-supplies/toner-cartridges/214132000']">ink
          cartridges
        </a> are the most reusable component part of a printer. The plastic body’s cartridge can hold ink in two or more
        reservoirs and is fitted with electric contacts. The plastic body of the cartridge holds the ink in one or more
        separate
        reservoirs and is fitted with electric contacts and sometimes a chip which allows the cartridge to communicate
        with
        the printer. Depending on the size and style of the printer, there are different types of cartridges. Cartridges
        are basically designed for working with a specific series of
        <a [routerLink]="['/office-supplies/office-machines/printers/214191500']">printers</a>.</p>
      <p class="lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">While you need to pay attention to size and brand of the cartridge for
        functioning properly, the type of ink cartridge
        needs to be correct when performing specific print jobs like photographs.
        <em>Ink cartridges are of two types- </em>
        <strong>thermal and piezoelectric</strong>.</p>
      <p class="lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Pricing is a major factor which you will need to pay attention. A few companies
        offer cartridges at very low prices
        but offer very bad products. However, inkjets are often available at a low price. Also check the warranty
        offered
        by the company. Some last for one month, while others offer two weeks while inkjet offer 1 full year.
      </p>
      <h3 class="f-size-17 pad-b-15 text-500">Projectors</h3>
      <p class="lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Since there are numerous types of projectors in the market, it’s easy to get
        confused.
        <strong>
          <a [routerLink]="['/office-supplies/computer-supplies/projectors/214131500']">Projectors</a>
        </strong>
        <em>are normally compared using four different types of factors: - </em>
        <strong>brightness, throw ratio, resolution and weight
        </strong>. Once these factors are taken into consideration, you can narrow down your choice further with
        secondary
        factors like warranty, lamp life and ratio. Some of the major factors which you will need to keep in mind while
        looking
        for projectors include its colour brightness and white brightness, resolution, contrast ratio and usability.
        Throw
        ratio is a specification which is determined by two major details-wideness of the screen and distance between
        projector
        from screen. For example, if the screen is 10 feet wide and projector is 15 feet away, you will require a lens
        which
        covers a throw ratio of 1:5:1</p>

        </a> are the devices which covers a document or other materials with a protective layer on both sides. Normally
        this

        The laminating machines which are used
        in offices are meant for official use while those that are used in schools are meant for moderate use.
        <em>Small or medium sized laminating machines are best suited for documents with size of 8.5’’</em>. Documents
        with size
        of 12’’ inches require small, medium &amp; large sized machines.</p>

      <h3 class="f-size-17 pad-b-15 text-500">Printers</h3>
      <p class="lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Though the new generations of printers are more versatile as compared to other
        models, printers are infamous for giving
        for causing more problems in contrast to any other computer peripheral. However,
        <strong>a little knowledge on how to clean printers can help you avoid paper jams and printing errors.</strong>
        Therefore,
        when you open a printer for maintenance, turn off its switch and keep your hands at a distance from hot fusers
        and
        moving parts within the printer. It will help in preventing unnecessary damage to the printer.
        <em>Buildup of dust, toner and other debris within a printer might cause jams ad ink streaks that appear on
          papers</em>.
        Utilise a quick fix to remove particles which have a small vacuum. It is ideal for dust removal.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-17 pad-b-15 text-500">Projectors</h3>
      <p class="lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Your projectors need little maintenance to keep working.
        <em>You will need to clean the air filter and air vents to protect the projector from overheating caused by
          blocked ventilation.</em>
        <strong>The only parts that you will need to replace are air filter, lamp and remote control batteries</strong>.
        Before cleaning
        any part of the projector, turn it off and unplug the power cord. Don’t open the projector’s cover as has
        explained

      <h3 class="f-size-17 pad-b-15 text-500">Laminating Machines</h3>
      <p class="lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Roll laminators are one of the most common document finishing machines with a
        good reason. These devices make it possible
        for you to laminate different items from photographs and banners. One of the most effective ways of maintaining
        you
        roll laminator in shape is
        <strong>avoid for processing items covered in glitter</strong>. The same thing is applicable for metallic
        materials. These
        docs can do a high level of damage. If glitter gets on the rollers, it will be tough for the machine to transfer
        heat, which makes them inoperable.</p>
      <p class="lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">
        <em>Ensure that you keep sharp objects like scissors, craft knives etc. away from your laminators</em>. They can
        nick
        and scratch the silicone on rollers. If this happens, you can repair or replace it is bad enough. Unless the
        laminator
        shuts down automatically, make sure that it’s turned off when you are done with your work. It helps in
        protecting
        the motor and minimising the risks of fire &amp; injury.</p>
