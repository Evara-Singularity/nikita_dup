          <li class="pad-tb-5 lh-24">Safety goggles which are made from premium quality of virgin resin polycarbonate
            material are known to offer
            <a href="{{API['PROD']}}/safety-and-security/safety-goggles/116111200">effective eye
              protection</a> for years together. Goggles with recycled resins are cheaper and have a higher degree
            of distortion. Their yellowing lenses also have poor durability.</li>
          <li class="pad-tb-5 lh-24">Zero distortion will enable you to view everything with greater clarity through
            <a href="{{API['PROD']}}/safety-and-security/safety-goggles/116111200">safety glasses</a>. You
            will be able to wear these types of lenses over a long span of time without any strain
            to the eyes.</li>
          <li class="pad-tb-5 lh-24">The fittings of the safety glasses are also an important factor which you will need
            to pay adequate attention to.
            One rule of thumb that you can follow is to check the width of the frame and nosepiece, length, and angle of
            temples. Safety glasses usually have a width between 4-6 inches from one temple hinge to another. Most of
            the
            safety glasses are made from normal size nosepieces and suits well for most people.</li>
          <li class="pad-tb-5 lh-24">You can acquire a higher level of comfort if the goggles which opt for come with a
            number of additional features.
            In case the pair you opt for comes with soft-nose pins, you will acquire a higher level of comfort. If the
            glasses
            have a soft piece on the area around your temple tip, then they will ensure a smoother fitting around your
            ears.</li>
          <li class="pad-tb-5 lh-24">The availability of replacement lenses can to a great extent bring down maintenance
            costs. Since the lens is the
            costliest part of safety glasses, it is always wise to look for goggles that come with replacement lenses.
            At
            present, there are numerous replacement options which are available in the Indian market include clear,
            gray,

        <p class="  lh-24 f-size-13 pad-b-5">
          <strong>Safety Shoes-</strong> One effective way to take care of your shoes is to change them on a regular
          basis. You can
          wear casual shoes rather than
          <strong>safety shoes</strong> once you return from your workplace. The leather is a natural fabric which
          requires time
          in order to recover. When kept indoors, leather shoes take almost twice as much time to get perspiration
          moisture
          in leather than they do while absorbing it. Therefore, if you have used a shoe for around 7 hours, make sure
          that
          it is kept as it is for 14 hours.</p>
        <p class="  lh-24 f-size-13 pad-b-5">
          <strong>Safety Goggles-</strong> Abrasions on glasses can make them unusable. Therefore, make it a point not
          to use abrasive
          cleaners to clean
          <strong>safety goggles</strong>.
          <em>The safety glasses need to be cleaned on a regular basis.</em> You can rinse the glasses using cool water
          for debris
          removal. Once the dirt has been removed, dry them with a soft cloth. You can also make use of a can of
          compressed
          air in order to remove the dust and dirt. The best option is to utilize a cloth which is specifically meant
          for
          cleaning glasses. Pre-moistened lens towels.</p>
        <p class="  lh-24 f-size-13 pad-b-5">
          <strong>Safety Helmets-</strong>
          <em>To clean safety helmets from time to time, soak its headline in mild, soapy water.</em> Avoid using
          solvents or
          chemicals in order to clean any part of the helmet as they might destroy protective coatings and damage its
          structural
          integrity. The air vents and channels of helmets can be cleaned using air compressed air. Let the headliner to
          air dry completely post washing and in between usage.</p>
        <p class="  lh-24 f-size-13 pad-b-5">
          <strong>Safety Gloves-</strong> Check the gloves with care before you wear them. Check whether they have any
          cracks, holes
          or tears or not. Chemicals can drip into your hands even from minute holes.
          <em>If the gloves you are using are disposable, then it would be wise to replace them immediately</em>. Apply
          soap
          and water on your hands before you put on the gloves. Make sure that the gloves are tightly closed outside the
          sleeve. In case you have to deal with liquid chemicals on a daily basis, you can utilize a heavy-duty tape or
          elastic
          band to seal the edge of your gloves. Make use of soap and water to wash the gloves before you take them off.
          Make
          it a part of your routine to wash your hands with care after taking off the gloves. Store the gloves in a
          container
          after you are finished with the day’s work.</p>

          disassemble
          the respiratory masks. You can take the help of the written instructions that usually come with masks. Once
