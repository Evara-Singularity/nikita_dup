        <h3>1. What are the new RBI guidelines? </h3>
        <p>As per the new RBI guidelines effective from October 1, 2022, merchants can no longer save customer credit or
            debit card details. Instead, customers must enter their complete card details for every payment done via
            card. </p>
        <h3>2. How can I avoid entering my card details every time I pay?</h3>
        <p>Customers can provide their consent, allowing Amazon Pay to tokenize (encrypt) and save their card as per new
            RBI guidelines. This means that Amazon Pay asks your card network to encrypt your card details with
            additional authentication. Amazon Pay receives the encrypted details which will be saved and used for future
            transactions instead of your actual card details.</p>
        <h3>3. How do I provide my consent to save the card? </h3>
        <p>When you add a new card or select a saved card to make a purchase, you will see a checkbox requesting you to
            provide the consent. Simply select the checkbox and continue with your payment on that card. Your consent
            will be successfully captured once the payment is complete. </p>
        <h3>4. How will I know which of my cards are not saved as per new regulations?</h3>
        <p>When you add a new card or select a saved card to make a purchase, you will see a checkbox requesting you to
            provide the consent. Simply select the checkbox and continue with your payment on that card. Your consent
            will be successfully captured once the payment is complete. </p>
        <h3>5. Do I need to provide consent separately for each card?</h3>
        <p>Yes, as per the RBI guidelines, you need to provide consent to save each card separately. </p>
        <h3>6. Which of my cards can be saved as per new RBI guidelines?</h3>
        <p>You can give consent to secure all credit and debit cards.</p>
        <h3>7. What will happen to my previously added cards? </h3>
        <p>Before September 30, 2022 you can give your consent to encrypt all your saved cards. This will ensure that
            you can continue to place orders and make payments as seamlessly as before. Cards for which we do not have
            your consent by September 30, 2022 will be removed, and you will need to enter the full card details to
            complete every payment. However, for your convenience, we also offer you the option to give consent and save
            your cards in the future as well.</p>
        <h3>8. My card is also stored in Amazon account of another friend or family member. Do they also need to save
            the card again as per RBI guidelines?</h3>
        <p>Yes, the card needs to be saved across every Amazon account by each customer individually. </p>
        <h3>9. Is there a limit on the number of accounts in which one card can be saved? </h3>
        <p>Please not that after September 30, 2022 one card can be saved as per new guidelines in a maximum of 10
            Amazon accounts. If any existing card is saved in more than 10 account onwards will be deleted even if the
            customer has given consent to save the card. </p>
        <h3>10. Which cards are impacted by the new RBI guidelines?</h3>
        <p>The new RBI guidelines are only applicable on debit and credit cards issued in India. There is no impact on
            cards issued outside of India and Bajaj Finserve EMI card (BFL card), and you can continue to save and use
            these card as you do today.</p>
        <h3>11. Will I need to give my consent for offline / in-store / transactions?</h3>
        <p>No, the new RBI guidelines are only applicable for online/e-commerce transactions.</p>
        <h3>12. Do I need to pay any charges for saving my card? </h3>
        <p>No, there is no charge for saving your card. </p>
        <h3>13. Is it mandatory to save my card(s)? </h3>
        <p>You can choose whether or not to save your cards. However, we recommend that you do so as it will ensure your
            purchase and payment experience remains as seamless as before. Cards which are not saved by September 30,
            2022 will be deleted as per RBI guidelines. Terms and conditions apply.</p>
