      <h3 class="pad-lr-30 pad-b-10">What are Hand Tools?</h3>
      <p class="pad-lr-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Ever since the dawn of human civilization, hand tools have played a
        major role in day to day lives. Hand tools such
        as screwdrivers, hammers, spanners, wrenches, strippers, cutters, vices and clamps, strippers and cutters,
        pliers,
        bars & handles form are essential for industrial applications, DIY projects, and workshops. To meet the needs of
        technicians, professionals, and office-based users, Moglix has come up with a wide range of hand tools online.
        The
        products that we are offering have been sourced from leading brands in the market such as GB Tools, Eastman,
        Taparia,
        Prima, Everest etc.</p>

      <h3 class="pad-lr-30 pad-t-30 pad-b-10">What are the different types of Hand Tools?</h3>
      <p class="pad-lr-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Hand tools are of different types and have been categorized according
        to their usage. Some of them are mentioned below
        for your reference:-</p>
      <div class="col-sm-3 border mar-l-20">
        <img src="{{API['IMAGE_BASE_URL']}}images/ht/1.jpg" alt="Screwdrivers ">

      <div class="col-sm-7 pad-l-30">
        <h4 class="">Screwdrivers</h4>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Screwdrivers are an effective tool for any type of industrial or
          home-based application. They are suitable for
          use in industrial settings, workshops as well as homes: -</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Screwdrivers are of different types. Slotted screwdrivers are one of
          the oldest types of screwdrivers. They are
          not much in use these days since users find it difficult to tighten them without damaging the head of the
          screwdrivers.
          Screwdrivers which have slotted heads need a tool which has a flat blade. The tapered tip’s angle when viewed
          from different angles is highly important as it will decide how the tip will grip the slot’s sides. Tools with
          good quality come with tips which are parallel to the tip. This ensures the tip doesn’t slip out the slot when
          it is under high torque values.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The Phillip tip screwdriver is another type of screwdriver which
          resembles a cross. But screwdrivers of this type
          which is of high quality have a round-shaped tip. They are usually marked with a number engraving on the head.
          This number specifies the size of the drive which is required. Philip tip screwdrivers of large sizes are
          ideal
          for use in industrial applications while for DIY purpose, screwdrivers with a drive in the size between 1 to
          4.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Torque screwdrivers are shaped in a way similar to a six-pointed
          star. However, their points are rounded off. They
          do not involve any angles and the large contact area that exists between the screw and its driver offers users
          with superb contact. Therefore, these screws can be easily tightened to high torque values as well. However,
          torque screwdrivers do have a drawback. These screws are quite shallow. So, users need to ensure that there is
          no dirt in the dirt which can minimize the effective contact area which exists between the drive and driver.
        </p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Hex Drives come with six even straight sides. Most of the hex drive
          fasteners that you will come across in the
          market are bolts rather than screws. However, there are screwdrivers that are available for driving these
          fasteners.
          Hex fasteners are normally used for assembling furniture. However, a T-handled Allen wrench would be a better
          alternative while working with these screws as it offers a higher torque value as compared to a screwdriver
          with
          a narrow handle.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-7 pad-l-30">
        <h4 class="">Hammers</h4>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Hammers are commonly used in homes, workshops and factories in a
          wide range of applications and DIY projects. Types
          of hammers available online are as follows: - -</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Club Hammers are most suitable for use in metalwork, light
          demolition, stone cutting and driving masonry nails.
          The new range of club hammers that have been launched in the Indian market come with a soft grip handle which
          makes them easy to use. Club hammers are produced from steel spring bars.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Copper Hammers are applied on machinery in order to exert a force on
          parts that have a lesser risk of damage and
          also for avoiding sparks. Compared to club hammers, copper hammers are softer and can be deformed if excessive
          force is applied to them. The copper hammers sourced by Moglix comply with DIN, ANSI, and ISO standards and
          are
          equipped with fiberglass handles.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Rubber Hammers are ideal for use in activities such as upholstery,
          leather work, sheet metal etc. The rubber hammers
          available at Moglix comply with the latest ISI specifications. They have been produced using the best quality
          of rubber and can also be used in applications such as PVC pipe work, laminate flooring and tap ceramic tiles
          into place during renovation projects at home.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Machinist Hammers are mostly used in metalworking. These hammers are
          often used by artisans in fabrication, casting,
          machining, jewelry making, metallurgy, and welding. What makes these machinist hammers different from other
          hammers
          is that they come with a variable shaped peen instead of a claw at the opposite end of the face. They are
          highly
          useful in order to strike to those areas which are tool mall for.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Ball/Cross Pein Hammers are best suited for use in striking and
          shaping metals. They are highly effective in creating
          the usual shape of materials used in metal fabrication. These hammers are also used for hitting punches and
          chisels.
          Ball pein hammers are best suited for use in riveting as a ball pein hammer is highly effective in riveting
          since
          the biggest risk in peening the rivet is when you hit the nail’s shaft from a close range.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Claw Hammers are used for hammering nails into wood and also for
          removing them. Therefore, they are mostly used
          in woodworking projects. To suit the needs of carpenters, Moglix offers claw hammers that come with CA
          hardened
          faces which ensure a long lifespan. These claw hammers have a mirror polished finish and are equipped with a
          rubber grip which makes them user-friendly. The magnetic claw hammers available at Moglix are equipped with a
          drop forge head produced from carbon steel. The claws of these hammers are hardened and tempered with a high
          level of precision. They come with good gripping edges and have hardened wooden handles that are chemically
          treated
          as part of the manufacturing process</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Mallets are used on a large scale in woodwork and carpentry. They
          are used for fixing pieces of wood together by
          striking the pieces till they fit within holes. Wooden mallets are used for producing and shaping a wide range
          of tools.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Sledge Hammers are highly valued by construction workers for their
          ability to break wall and for removing concrete
          slabs. They are also useful for driving bolts within concrete and for stake driving. The sledge hammers
          available
          at Moglix are equipped with wooden handles which are drop forged with carbon steel during the production
          process.

          and also for twisting wires. Different type
          of pliers are given below:-</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Fencing Pliers are mostly used for cutting wires, which often makes
          wire cutters inoperable. The main jabs of these
          pliers are shaped in a way so that they can easily grip staples and twitch them out from posts. The fencing
          pliers
          that are available at Moglix are produced from high-quality chrome vanadium steel and are hardened and
          tempered

        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Combination Pliers are used by electricians for twisting, bending,
          gripping as well as cutting wires and cables.
          The pliers that Moglix offers as a part of this range are equipped with jaws that are highly proficient in
          gripping
          and offer a cutting edge to users. They are equipped with insulating handles which minimize the risk of the
          user
          being exposed to electric shocks caused by contact with live wires. Therefore, these combination pliers form
          a part and parcel of every electrician’s tool kit.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Water Pump Pliers are gripping pliers that come with an adjustable

        <h4 class="">Strippers and Cutters</h4>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Stripper & Cutter can prove to be extremely useful when cutting
          metallic wires, cables, adjusting nuts and bolts
          and what not. Wire strippers work on simple physics they have two blades (opposing in mature) much like a pair
          of scissors. The center notch present on their designs makes it simpler to make a cut in the insulation of
          wires
          without actually harming the wire. The types of strippers and cutters available at Moglix are as follows: -
        </p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Scissors are one of the most common tools that are used in almost
          every home, workshop and factory setting. While

          beryllium alloy etc. They are suitable for use in workshops as well as DIY alloys.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Pipe Cutters are mostly used by plumbers for cutting pipes. As a
          tool, pipe cutters offer clean cuts and are more
          effective in cutting pipes as compared to hacksaws.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Spare Blades are used almost on a daily basis in a wide range of
          home based applications. The new range of spare

          Wire strippers are highly effective in cutting and stripping. The new ones which are available in the market
          come with a convenient hole which makes it convenient for users to loop or bend the wire. Wire cutters and
          stripers are highly effective in cutting through cold reeled as well as stainless steel.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Cutting Blades are normally used in woodworking. The speed of a
          cutting blade depends on its number of teeth.
          The ones that come with more teeth are able to provide a good quality of finish. These hand tools are equipped
          with gullets between the teeth for removal of chips from workpieces. The expansion slots present in cutting
          blades help in cutting within the rim and ensure that the blade doesn’t bend while expand or contract while
          it is being used. They minimize vibrations, which ensures that the carpenter can make a straighter cut.</p>

        <h4 class="">Spanners and Wrenches</h4>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Spanners and wrenches are used for gripping and turning objects such
          as nuts, bolts, and rotary fasteners. Spanners
          and wrenches are highly efficient in fastening and loosening nuts and bolts. They are thus widely used by
          technicians
          and industrial workers: -</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Ring Spanners are those spanners which hold the nut with a ring.
          Ring spanners have a fully enclosed head and usually,
          come with six or twelve flats. These types of spanners are normally used in corners of nuts and can be applied
          on hexagon and square bolts. We, at Moglix, present a unique range of ring spanners.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Combination Spanners, on the other hand, are open-ended at one end
          and have a ring on the other. The combination
          spanners that are offered by Moglix have been manufactured by well-known brands such as Ajay, Ambika, Eastman,
          GB Tools, Jhalani etc.</p>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Adjustable Wrenches normally fit into screws and bolts. However, a
          major problem with them is that might not lock
          tightly with a nut or bolt. The adjustable wrenches are highly effective in holding the head of bolts while

        <h3 class="">Things to Consider Before Buying Hand Tools</h3>
        <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">One of the first things that you will need to pay attention to is the work
          for which you will be using them. So,
          you need to select a hand tool after checking the manufacturer’s recommendations. Doing so will ensure that
          the
          tool doesn’t get damaged while you are using it. The price of the tool should also be taken into
          consideration.
          But make sure that you don’t compromise on the quality of the product. Also, check the technicality of the
          device
          that you are going to buy. A clear idea about the characteristics of the tool will help you to be sure whether
          it will suit your needs or not. Check whether the device you are going to buy has a guarantee or warranty or
          not. The products that come with a warranty can be replaced if they have a defect during the warranty period.

        <h3 class="">Hand Tools Maintenance Tips</h3>
        <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">To ensure that your tools remain in the best working condition, you need to
          ensure that they are well maintained.
          Start the maintenance process with the tune-up process. Tools such as chisels do not come in a ready to use
          working
          condition. Often, the sole will have a hollow in its length or with which will have to be corrected before it
          can be worked properly. Tools such as chisels and scrapers require a tune-up to do away with burrs which can
          have an impact on their performance.</p>
        <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Rusting is a common problem with most hand tools. Once you make sure that
          your hand tools kits are well tuned,
          it is a challenge to maintain it in that manner. Hand tools can out last power tools if they are maintained
          with
          care. By ensuring that the tool box is free from moisture, you can check any possibility of rusting. Also,
          ensure
          that your tools are free from scratches and dents. This will ensure that your hand tools provide you with a
          perfect,
          highly satisfactory quality of service over a long span of time.</p>
