      <h3 class="f-size-17">What are Inverters?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">An inverter is a device that is used for converting low-voltage DC current
        into AC current which is normally used within
        homes, shops or offices. An inverter is highly useful for operating a wide range of household appliances and
        electrical
        equipment using the power produced by an automobile or boat battery. It can also utilize renewable sources of
        energy
        like solar panels and wind turbines.

      <h3 class="f-size-17">How are Inverters Normally Used?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">nverters are highly effective in protecting valuable belonging within a home
        during power cuts by offering emergency
        power backup to a wide range of accessories such as freezers, telephones, medical equipment and sumo pumps.
        Inverters
        also ensure power access to a wide range of electrical equipment that are used in our day to day lives such as
        cars,
        trucks, boats and RVs.</p>

      <h3 class="f-size-17">What are The Different Types of Inverters?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Though most of the inverters that you would come across look similar, yet they
        tend to differ greatly on the basis
        of the type of battery (tubular and flat), power and waveform (sine and square) that they offer. Here are some
        of
        the common types of inverters:-</p>

      <div class="col-sm-3 border mar-l-20">
        <img src="{{API['BASE_URLS']['IMAGE_BASE_URL']}}images/inverter/1.jpg" alt="Solar Inverters">

      <div class="col-sm-7 pad-l-30">
        <h4 class="f-size-17">Solar Inverters</h4>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">A solar inverter is used for converting variable direct current(DC)
          output from a photovoltaic solar panel into current(AC)
          thereby providing you with ample power. During daytime, the battery charges itself through the use of solar
          energy
          and once it gets charged to a particular level, the stored energy is used in order to provide electricity. As
          in
          the case of any other solar product, solar inverters come with an advantage over other inverters as they can
          be
          easily installed and use a renewable source of energy in order to convert to electricity.</p>

      <div class="col-sm-7 pad-l-30">
        <h4 class="f-size-17">Digital UPS(Uninterruptible Power Supply)</h4>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">There is a slight difference between inverter and digital UPS when
          it comes to switch over time. Digital UPS takes
          a shorter switch-over time span as compared to digital UPS. The former runs with the help of Digital Signal
          Processing
          Techniques(DSP) techniques for converting waves into Pure Sine waves rather than older methods such as Square
          Wave
          or Stepped Sine Wave. Pure Sine Waves are more suitable for use in appliances such as TV, fans, refrigerators,
          fans and TV.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h3 class="f-size-17">Types of Wave Output</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Inverters usually have two types of wave output-modified sine wave and true
        sine wave. Modified sine wave inverters
        are the most widely used and are comparatively cheaper as compared to their true sine wave counterparts. They
        are
        highly efficient and are suitable for use in home appliances. They are smaller in size in comparison to the
        other
        inverters which you may come across. True sine wave inverters are highly priced. They also deliver high-quality
        wave
        output on a consistent basis. They come with a high surge capacity and so they might exceed the rated wattage
        for
        a short span of time which is useful to start a number of appliances such as laptops, battery chargers etc. ACs
        also
        run using this type of inverters.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h3 class="f-size-17">Applications of Inverters</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Inverters are widely used in home and remote sites. Lightweight inverters are
        ideally used in vans, cars, and mini-SUVs.
        Heavy duty inverters, on the other hand, are most suitable for trucks, boats, and RVs.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h3 class="f-size-17">Find Out The VA (Volt Ampere) Ratings That Your Inverter Needs</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">One common mistake that buyers often make is regarding VA ratings and watt
        ratings as the same. Appliances that are
        used in homes such as lights, fans, bulbs and ACs consume power and are therefore rated in watts. However,
        inverters
        which are used for generating power without any sort of interruption come with VA ratings. VA is the output of
        voltage
        of the current that is generated by the current that the equipment supplies. Therefore, whenever you buy an
        inverter,
        don’t get duped by manufacturers into believing that both of them are the same.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h3 class="f-size-17">How Long Can Your Inverter Run Without Power?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The efficiency of an inverter to a great extent depends on the amount of power
        that it draws. The power drawing capacity
        of an inverter may vary between 90-50% from full load to light load. One thing that you need to find out is
        whether
        the efficiency of the inverter is high on maximum load or not. Normally, an inverter offers the highest level of
        efficiency when it is used at around 1/3 to 3/4 of its full rating. Small inverters that are used in vehicles
        can
        run indefinitely as long as the vehicle’s engine is running and there is sufficient battery power. Larger
        inverters,
        on the other hand, can offer power over extended time periods. All that you need to do is to add more batteries.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h3 class="f-size-17">What Input and Output Voltages Do You Need?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The DC input voltage of an inverter any value in the range above the 43-57V
        and between 40-65V are most suitable in
        homes. Ideally, inverters that have input voltages can endure overheating without any type of heating. One that
        you
        need to take note of is the fact that power consumption (current drain) increases once the driving voltage
        starts
        decreasing. When input voltage drops at your home from 230 V AC to 200 VAC, the electric appliances will consume
        a greater amount of energy.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h3 class="f-size-17">What Input and Output Voltages Do You Need?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The inverter will have to be needed to ensure continuous single phase single
        wave output at 230V/50 Hz AC according
        to your requirement. It will be capable of delivering 6KVA at some power factor from unity to 0.8 lagging. Once
        the
        output gets completely energized, it will build up within a period of 5 seconds. You can set the inverter’s
        output
        at any value that is between 225 to 235 V. The device will need to be maintained within +/-2% of set value for
        input
        voltage between 42 to 57 V DC, variations in load power variation between unity and 0.8 lagging and load current
        variations between zero to 100%(full load).
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h3 class="f-size-17">What Features Should You Look for in an Inverter?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">VA (Volt-Ampere) Rating- The rating is used for calculating the load which an
        inverter can take. For instance, an inverter
        can have a rating of 1000VA or 1500VA.</p>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Safety Features- Having a wide range of safety features such as overload
        protection, over volt protection,</p>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">auto-reset feature, audio alarm and short circuit protection can prove to be
        very effective for your inverter.</p>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Battery Charging Time- There are some models of inverters that indicate the
        time taken for the battery to get fully
        charged. Luminous, Crompton Greaves and G Solar are some of the brands that offer inverters which indicates the
        time
        taken for battery to get fully charged.</p>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Warranty-Make it a point to check the warranty period on the inverter that you
        plan to buy. It may be convenient for
        you to opt for an inverter and battery that belongs to the same brand so that you can have it serviced by the
        manufacturer.
        However, one thing that you should take note of is that the batteries of inverters require more maintenance than
        the inverters itself.</p>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Power consumption- Before you select any inverter, it is important to
        calculate a rough estimate of your home’s total
        power consumption. This is because if you have too many gadgets at home, it may not be possible for an inverter
        to
        support all of them at once.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h3 class="f-size-17">What Type of Batteries Should You Opt for?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The batteries on inverters are usually of three types- lead acid batteries,
        tubular batteries, and maintenance free
        batteries. Lead acid batteries require daily maintenance. You need to check the electrolyte levels and refill
        them
        from time to time. Tubular batteries tend to be expensive but ensure high efficiency without lesser maintenance.
        They have a long lifespan. Maintenance free batteries as their name suggest require little or minimal care. They
        are sealed lead acid batteries These batteries are also expensive and tend to have little scrap value.</p>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Usually, the size of a battery is decided by the projected run time and the
        wattage load that it takes. Batteries of
        inferior quality can cause problems in discharging and cause serious damage to your inverter. The normal method
        which
        is used to measure the size of a battery is mentioned below: -
      </p>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5 font-weight-bold">Battery size = Inverter rating in watts ÷ input voltage x
        usage time (hrs.).</p>

      <div class="col-sm-7 pad-l-30">
        <h4 class="f-size-17">AH (Ampere Hour) Rating</h4>
        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Ampere Hour is a unit of measurement of electrical capacity which
          the battery can store. The current is multiplied
          by time in hours which equals to ampere-hours. This is the most important measure which you need to focus upon
          while measuring an inverters battery. A current of 40 amps for one hour would be 40 AH at the hourly rate.
          Similarly,
          a current of 40 amps for 5 hours would be at 200 AH at the 5 hr. rate. AH ratings tend to vary on the basis of
          temperature and discharge. For instance, a battery which comes with 100 AH at 6-hour rating may be rated 125
          AH at the 48-hour rate. The rating can change during usage because of the effects related to internal
          resistance
          and effects of temperature.

        <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The normal lifespan of inverters depends on a number of factors.
          This includes electric loads, high internal temperatures,
          direct lightning strikes, extremely high ambient temperatures and poor quality of local area network. Usually,
          well maintained inverters last up to 5 years.

    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h3 class="f-size-17">How Will You Select Inverters?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">While buying an inverter for your home, first and foremost, you need to focus
        on the power requirement. So, you will
        need to take into account all electrical appliances such as CFL, TV, fans etc. that you want to use even during
        power
        cuts. The power requirement refers to the addition of power consumed by different types of electrical equipment.
      </p>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Check the VA rating of the inverter which you intend to buy. If you find that
        it operates with complete efficiency,
        then the power required by the electrical appliances at your home and the power supplied by the inverter will be
        the same. However, we all that an indicator with 100% efficiency doesn't exist in real life. The normal ones
        that
        you will come across have an efficiency between 60-80%. This efficiency is also known as power factor of an
        inverter
        and is the ratio of power needed by the appliances in order to provide the power supplied by the inverter. The
        power
        factor of the majority of inverters is usually between 0.6-0.8.</p>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The normal formula that you will need to apply is VA=Power Requirement/Power
        Factor. The average value of power factor/efficiency
        is regarded as 0.7. Inverters with 800VA are available in the market. So, an inverter with 800 VA would be the
        best
        choice for your home. Another area that you will need to pay a good deal of attention to is the inverter’s
        battery.</p>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Another area that you will need to check out is the battery of the inverter
        that you are opting for. The battery is
        the lifeline of an inverter. The battery capacity is one of the most important things that you will need to pay
        attention
        to. The battery capacity is the deciding factor for backup hours. It is a measurement in Ah (Ampere hours). You
        will
        come across batteries that come with the capacity of 100 Ah, 150 Ah etc. in the market. So, how would you decide
        which one you would require? In order to find that out, you will need to perform a reverse calculation.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <h3 class="f-size-17">How to Install Inverters?</h3>
      <p class=" lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">During the installation process of the inverter, you will require a number of
        materials such as batteries, a shelving
        unit, battery encloser, fuse and fuse holder. The tools that will prove to be effective during the process of
        installation
        include a head screwdriver, socket wrench, flat head screwdriver, electrical tape, utility knife, superglue,
        Allen
        wrench and a wire/cable cutter.</p>
      <ul class="">
        <li class="f-size-12">At a first step, you will need to assemble the shelving unit and ensure that it fits the
          space which is next to inverter.
          But remember one thing. The assembled system will be very difficult for you to move. Therefore, you will need
          to
          make sure that you don’t have to move it once you have installed everything. Ensure that the battery enclosure
          and inverter/charger fits within the shelves of the shelving unit.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">Following this, you will need to prepare the lead cables. The lead cables which are long,
          black cables which come
          with a battery enclosure, which will connect your batteries with your inverter. They come with ring terminals
          on
          each end which you can use for bolting the cable to the unit. But before, connecting them, you will have to
          modify
          them. First and foremost, you will need to cut the long red cable to about ¾ of the way from the lower end.
          Once
          you do that, a strip around a ½ inch of the insulation from each of the cut ends.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">Then, cut the small ring terminal off the black cable’s end. Then strip it in the same
          manner as you would by stripping
          the red cable. Wrap the heat shrink tubing to the stripped end of both the cables. This will help you in
          ensuring
          that no short circuit takes place when you complete the installation. Once you do that, remove the battery
          enclosure’s
          cover and remove the wires and cables which come with it. Do away with the top shelf from the shelving unit
          and
          put the empty enclosure whose top has been removed within the middle shelf.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">Connect the short black cable with the negative terminal which is farthest from the
          openings of the battery enclosure.
          The process will need to be replicated. First you will need to put the ring terminal down, followed by flash
          washer,
          lock washer and bolt. First and foremost, you will need to thread the long black cable through the battery
          enclosure’s
          opening end which has a negative mark with the ring terminal inside the battery enclosure and the stripped end
          outside it.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">Connect the short black cable’s free end with that of the black lead cable which you
          entered through the other battery’s
          negative terminal’s hole. Then, repeat the process of putting the ring terminals down first, followed by the
          flat
          washer, then the lock washer and the bolt. It is essential for you to connect the negative terminal of the
          battery
          to the other’s positive terminal. Therefore, you will need to be very cautious.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">At the next step, connect the short red cable with the positive terminal of the battery
          which is the farthest from
          the battery enclosure’s openings. While doing so, you will need to put the ring terminal down first, and then
          the
          flat washer, lock washer and bolt serially. Then, thread the long red cable through the opening of the battery
          enclosure which has a positive mark with the ring terminal within the battery enclosure and fuse to the
          outside.
          After you do that, connect the free end of the short red cable with the red lead cable which you thread
          through
          hole of the other battery’s positive terminal. Then, repeat the process of putting the ring terminals down
          first,
          followed by a flash washer, dishwasher and then the bolt. You will need to be very cautious while connecting
          the
          positive terminal of a battery with the other’s negative terminal.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">Cross check your connections and then place the red plastic terminal covers which you
          obtained with the battery enclosure
          over the ‘+’ battery terminals. You might need to cut additional openings in the terminal cover with your
          utility
          cover so as to ensure that they fit tightly. If you don’t have terminal covers, then utilize heat shrink
          tubing
          over each of the battery terminals. Then, place the cover on the battery enclosure. Connect the short black
          cable
          with the negative terminal which is farthest from the openings of the battery enclosure. The process will need
          to be replicated. First you will need to put the ring terminal down, followed by flash washer, lock washer and
          bolt. First and foremost, you will need to thread the long black cable through the battery enclosure’s opening
          end which has a negative mark with the ring terminal inside the battery enclosure and the stripped end outside
          it.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">Verify your connections and before placing the red plastic terminal covers which you
          obtained with the battery enclosure
          over the ‘+’ battery terminals. Secure it with the screws that you took while removing them. Put the top shelf
          over your shelving unit, and then install the charger inverter on it.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">The next step will involve attaching leads to the inverter. At the initial stage, you will
          need to remove the electrical
          tape from the black leads stripped end and connect it with inverter’s negative terminal. Once you do that, you
          will need to connect the red lead’s stripped end to the inverter’s positive terminal. One thing that you
          shouldn’t
          miss out at this stage is that the black cable should be connected to the ‘’- “terminal while the red cable
          with
          the positive terminal. You might come across sparks on touching the red lead to the terminal on the inverter.
          This
          is quite normal as the circuit between batteries and inverter is under completion. If you don’t experience it
          at
          this stage, then something may be wrong somewhere.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">At the next step, you will need to connect the temperature sensing cable with the jack
          which is located on the back
          of the inverter. It is labeled as ‘’remote temperature’’. The best place for installing the temperature sensor
          is the area close to the negative terminal.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">There are a few dip switches on the inverter’s front panel which control the major
          settings which have an impact
          on the way it works. You will need to take the help of the user manual to detect to find the exact manner in
          which
          the settings will need to be selected.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">After the configuration process of the inverter is complete, you will need to plug the
          inverter within the outlet
          wallet. You may hear a slight humming noise from the unit after the batteries start charging. This humming
          sound
          will stop once the batteries get fully charged. Once the charging is complete, plug the sump pump within your
          inverter.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">esting is a must so as to ensure that your inverter functions perfectly. The most
          effective way of testing your system
          is to apply a hose or bucket to fill the sump with sufficient water till it activates. Perform this twice,
          once
          after plugging the inverter into the utility power and then again after the inverter is disconnected from
          utility
          power. This will make the sump pump run using the batteries. In case the sump pump operates normally in both
          situations,
          then it will indicate that you have been successful in installing the battery backup system.

      <h4 class="f-size-17">How to Maintain Inverters?</h4>
      <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">In order to ensure that your inverter offers a high quality of
        service, you need to follow a number of steps to ensure
        its optimum maintenance. Here are some tips that will help you to take proper care of your inverter:-</p>
      <h4 class="f-size-17">Battery Maintenance</h4>
      <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">The battery is the most important component of the inverter that
        requires continuous maintenance to remain in the best
        working condition. If you have children at home, then it is wise to keep the inverter at a place which is not
        within
        their reach. Batteries that do not require any type of maintenance will need to be taken care of to ensure that
        no
        rusting takes place in the terminals.</p>
      <h4 class="f-size-17">Terminal Rusting</h4>
      <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">In order to clean the terminals of a battery, you will first need to
        switch off the inverters power supply. Then, remove
        the battery cables from the terminals. You will need to take a high level of precaution while removing terminal
        connections
        so as to make sure that you are not injured by any shorting and sparks. If the level of corrosion on the
        terminals
        is excessive, then you may find it difficult to remove them. If you are faced with such a situation, then don’t
        apply
        too much pressure through tapping as the terminal can break internally. Instead, use a cup of boiling water and
        add
        a 2-3 spoon of baking soda into it. Pour the solution into the battery terminals. Then, wait for a while before
        removing
        the terminals and removing the connections.</p>
      <h4 class="f-size-17">Avoid Using Tap Water</h4>
      <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">One common mistake that users often make while toping up is to opt for
        tap water. Technicians recommend the use of
        distilled water as tap water often contains impurities such as minerals and chemicals that react with battery
        electrodes
        and reduces the lifespan of inverters. Instead, you can use the water that has been drained out from ACs which
        is
        a better alternative for using. It is important to check the electrolyte levels </p>
      <h4 class="f-size-17">Ensure Proper Loading</h4>
      <p class="pad-r-30 lh-22 f-size-12 pad-b-5">Never make the mistake of overloading an inverter. It will have an
        adverse impact on the battery as well as the performance
        of the device. Avoid connecting the inverter with appliances that need high starting loads such as drilling
        machines,
        washing machines, and microwaves. You can run power energy based home appliances like ACs, heaters,
        refrigerators
        etc. with the help of high energy inverters but keeping convenience in mind, you should opt for generators with
        high
        load requirements for domestic use. </p>
