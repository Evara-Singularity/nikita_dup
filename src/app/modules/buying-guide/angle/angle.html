      <p class="f-12 lh-22">An
        <strong>
          angle grinder

        </strong> is a
        <strong>handheld power tool</strong> which is usually used for cutting, grinding and polishing. Also known as
        side or disc
        or angle grinder, it
        <em>can be powered in three ways- through petrol engine, compressed air or an electric motor</em>. Normal angle
        grinder
        components include an
        <em>abrasive disc, side handle, adjustable guard, and geared head</em>. The geared head which is mounted at a
        right
        angle, the geared head holds either a disc or wheel which are responsible for sanding, polishing and grinding
        different
        types of materials.</p>

      <h2 class="mar-t-30 f-size-17 mar-tb-10">Usage and Applications of Angle Grinders</h2>
      <p class="f-12 lh-22">Angle grinders are usually used in construction sites, metalworking shops, and car
        repairing. They are mainly used
        for cutting or notches. Angles grinders are also highly efficient for smoothing and removal of unnecessary
        materials.
        Angle grinder discs are of different types and are usually in different activities and materials such as
        polishing
        pads, sanding discs, wire brush wheels, grinding stones, cut-off discs, and abrasive grinding discs. Know-how of
        different aspects of angle grinders, including a selection of the right model for a specific project, can help
        you in taking a wise buying decision.</p>
      <p class="f-12 lh-22">It is most commonly used in grinding or sanding of protruding or excess stone, metal or
        mortar. Construction workers
        often use angle grinders while sharpening stone, metalworking, doing notches and cuts. Apart from these
        functions,
        angle grinders can be used in different types of applications such as
        <em>blade sharpening</em> and
        <em>removal of mortar in homes and gardens</em>. Home based cutting tools which need to be sharpened on a daily
        basis
        include

        based user
        to buy a specific one. Though you may feel lured to buy an affordable model, it may prove to be a bad idea
        unless
        the grinder is used in small projects on an infrequent basis. So, investing a higher sum on a sturdy model which
        offers optimum safety is a wise thing to do.</p>
      <p class="f-12 lh-22">An angle grinder is not suitable for use everywhere. You will need to take into
        consideration the tool’s motor power

          highly demanded sizes include 4.5 inches and 9 inches. Occasionally, a handyman can opt for a pneumatic
          grinder
          which comes with smaller disc sizes. They are more effective for use in minor applications rather than an

      </p>
      <p class="f-12 lh-22">One of the best the safest ways of staying safe from injuries is to unplug the tool while
        you are changing the wheels.
        After a new disc is attached, you will need to test it in a protected area. You will get to know about its
        functionality
        as a result. While using a safety guard, you will need to use the safety guard to say safe from risks of cuts.

        it easier for you to handle
        an angle grinder.

      <div class="wp-75 wp-xs-100 ">
        <p class="f-12 lh-22">
          <strong>Cutting Rebars-</strong> You will need to mount a metal cutoff in your angle grinder.
          <em>Pile up the rebar and hold it firmly</em>. Then, throw the cutoff metal wheel through the metal, enabling
          the
          tool’s weight to do lion’s share of the work. Let the short end to drop freely. This will ensure that the
          blade
          doesn’t bind.</p>
        <p class="f-12 lh-22">
          <strong>Scoring the Face of the Tile-</strong>
          <em>Mark the cut’s outline precisely on the tile’s front and back. </em> Clamp to the workbench and create an
          outline
          which is around 1/8-inch-deep on the diamond blade’s front end.</p>
        <p class="f-12 lh-22">
          <strong>Cutting Through Old Mortar-</strong>
          <em>Grinding is effective in beating the
            <strong>chisel</strong> and
            <strong>hammer</strong> for removing old mortar</em>. If you have to do a lot of tuck pointing, then it
          would be wise
          to go for a grinder specifically for mortar removal. Thick diamond tuck-pointing wheels can remove old mortar
          instantly without causing any type of damage to the bricks. However, since it creates a lot of dust, you
          should
          wear a dust mask and shut down your windows.</p>

      <h2 class="mar-t-30 f-size-17 mar-tb-10">Important Measures to Take While Using Angle Grinders?</h2>
      <p class="f-12 lh-22">The motor of angle grinders runs at a very high speed (10,000-11000 rpm), which is far
        higher than that of the drill
        motors. Drill motors run at a speed of 700-1200 rpm. Their speed can be therefore scary. Here are some
        precautions
        which you need to use for the safe use of the grinder: -</p>
      <ul class="pad-t-30">
        <li class="pad-tb-5 f-12">Use gloves and a face shield.</li>
        <li class="pad-tb-5 f-12">Unplug the grinder while changing the wheels.</li>
        <li class="pad-tb-5 f-12">Attach the handle and maintain a firmer grip using both of your hands.</li>
        <li class="pad-tb-5 f-12">Utilize a guard in case it is possible.</li>
        <li class="pad-tb-5 f-12">Operate the new wheels for a single minute in a protected area before use to be
          assured that the wheel is flawless.
        </li>
        <li class="pad-tb-5 f-12">Position the work in order to direct the debris downward.</li>
        <li class="pad-tb-5 f-12">Keep away bystanders. All people standing close need to use safety glasses.</li>
        <li class="pad-tb-5 f-12">Position the wheel in a precise manner to ensure that the wheel spins away from, and
          not within sharp edges. Wheels,
          especially wire wheels might catch the edge and throw the workpiece or cause a kickback of the grinder.
        </li>
        <li class="pad-tb-5 f-12">Maintain a distance of the grinder’s sparks from flammable materials. Clamp the
          workpiece in a similar manner.
        </li>
        <li class="pad-tb-5 f-12">Keep the angle grinder away from the reach of your children.</li>
