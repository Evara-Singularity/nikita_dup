      <h2 class="f-size-17 ">What are Wires and Cables?</h2>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Wire is a type of metal which is either drawn or shaped in a way that it is far longer
        than its cross section. Normally,
        <strong>wires </strong>come with either round or cylindrical cross-section. Wires can be used in a wide range of
        applications
        such as
        <a class="text-blue f-size-13" [routerLink]="['/electricals/211000000']">electrical equipment
        </a>, chain-link fences, hay bales etc. An

          <strong>electric wire</strong>
        </a> is usually made of copper.
        <em>Copper wires are best suited for use in electrical applications</em> because of features such as resistance
        to corrosion,
        thermal conductivity, ductility, resistance to electrical overloads etc.</p>

          <strong>cable</strong>
        </a> is usually made from two or more wires that tend to run side by side. They are bonded, twisted and
        sometimes braided
        together in order to create a single assembly. The end of the cables can also be connected to, two devices,
        thereby
        allowing transfer of electrical signals to take place between them.
        <strong>Cables</strong> can also be used in different applications such as the electronic devices which are used
        in power
        and signal circuits.</p>

      <h2 class="f-size-16 mar-t-20  ">Difference Between Wires and Cables</h2>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Though users refer to wire and cable interchangeably, there are some major differences
        between the two.
        <strong>A wire comes with a single electrical conductor</strong> (a material like copper or aluminum that
        conducts electricity
        and enables it to flow through the wire).
        <strong>A cable, on the other hand, has multiple conductors which are wrapped in a nonconductive material known
          as ‘jacket’</strong>.</p>

          line is that these cables have an electromagnetic cable that carries the signal in the space between inner and
          outer conductors. This enables a coaxial cable to be installed next to metal objects without any possibility
          of power losses that occur in case of other types of transmission lines. They also protect the signal from

          <em>widely used in wired networks</em>. They are normally
          <strong>used to connect the LAN</strong> with devices such as routers, switches, and PCs. Ethernet cables are
          of two
          types-solid and stranded. Solid ethernet cables offer a better quality of performance apart from better
          protection
          from electrical interference. They are widely used for wiring business networks within offices or under floors
          of labs in fixed locations. Stranded ethernet cables, on the other hand, are less likely to suffer from
          physical
          cracks and breaks. They are ideal for people who have to travel on a frequent basis.</p>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Ethernet cables usually support one or more industry standards such as
          <strong>Category 5(CAT5)

        <a class="text-blue f-size-13" [routerLink]="['/electricals/wires-cables/211190000']">wires and cables</a>. Here
        are some of the most important areas which you should pay attention to while selecting
        different types of wires and cables: -</p>
      <h4 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Voltage</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>One of the first things that you will need to pay attention is the voltage of the wire or cable which you
          are going
          to buy</em>. The insulation breakdown voltage of a cable is specified by the manufacturer post testing. You
        will
        come across this specification on the cable drum. If the specification is higher than the system voltage, then
        everything
        is OK. So, it is quite normal to use a cable with a voltage of 100']0V on a 24-volt system.</p>
      <h4 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Strength and Durability</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>The next area which you will need to focus on is the wire’s strength and durability.
        </em> Selecting a cable of appropriate strength has more to do with common sense. The cables which are used
        within
        mobile phones are of very small size. The cable insulation should also be tolerant to other chemicals which it
        might
        get in contact with. The cables which are used in engine bays need to be oil and fuel resistant.
      </p>
      <h4 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Ability to Handle Overheating</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>One thing which you need to pay attention to is the ability of the wire/cable to handle currents safely
          without overheating
          it or its insulation</em>. It can be calculated from the current that passes through the cable and its
        resistance
        (it will show the amount of heat which is generated).</p>
      <h4 class="mar-top">Size of The Wire and Cable</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>Experts always recommend users to opt for a much larger cable or wire</em>. This is almost always the same
        for low
        voltage systems. Here, you will mainly need to pay attention to the acceptable volt drop down of the cable when
        a
        certain current passes through it. This is indeed a major issue which is commonly faced by buyers in case of low
        voltage systems rather than high voltage systems.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>Wires are measured on the basis of their gauge sizes</em>. Though when these sizes starow bg-white
        pad-tb-15d to
        be used is uncertain, yet there is valuable evidence which suggests that 0 gauge was the size of the original
        blank
        before being drawn through any die. The succeeding numbers refer to the number of dies through which a wire is
        drawn
        through. Each of them is of consistently small size.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Because of this reason,
        <strong>wire gauge sizes</strong> that fail to fit into any other measurement system. Neither do they follow any
        logical
        pattern. The very same gauge numbers are used in both solid and stranded wire, through in order to have the same
        cross-section area, stranded wires are usually of a slightly bigger diameter.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">A wire’s current carrying capacity depends on the wire gauge.
        <strong>A wire with a larger gauge can carry a greater amount of current without overheating</strong>. On the
        other hand,
        if a wire gauge which is too small is used in an application, there is a high chance that the copper wire
        conductor
        may heat to the melting point of insulation or in the case of power transmission applications, for the wire to
        stretch
        to the breaking point.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Measure the distance which exists between the different components to ensure that the
        cables you select are long enough.
        This would be more important in case your cables have been shelved in a way which makes the rear panels
        difficult
        to gain access to. There needs to be sufficient slack to enable you to pull the component forward in order to
        reach
        out to the rear panel. But if it is possible try to avoid long cable runs as they are likely to cause signal
        degradation.</p>

      <h2 class="f-size-16 mar-t-20  ">Tips for Installing Wires and Cables</h2>
      <a class="text-blue f-size-13" name="tips"></a>
      <h4 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">
        Think of a Long Term Plan</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Consider whether the cables and wires you are going to install will work effectively 10
        years down the line or not.
        Consider the devices which you are likely to add to your property in the years to come.
      </p>
      <h4 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Go Ahead with a Floor Plan</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>Use a pencil to detect the areas in a floor plan where you want the devices to be installed
        </em>. Also, decide on the exact devices which you want to be present within the room. For instance, if want a
        greater
        number of devices to be installed within the room and have more power within the bedroom in order to listen to
        music
        or watch videos. You might intend to have greater functionality within the kitchen as well in order to gain
        control
        over all devices from a central location.</p>
      <h4 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Mark The Areas Where the Wiring and Outlets Will Be Installed</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">On the floor plan, mark the areas where the wires shall run and the parts of the room
        where wall outlets shall be installed.
        Find out the devices which will require a coaxial cable and the ones that will require an ethernet cable. Decide
        which devices would be wireless and where they will be placed.</p>
      <h4 class="mar-top">Run All the Wires Across All Parts of Your Premises</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">The structured at the minimum level comprise two coax cables and two pairs of
        unshielded twisted CAT5 or CAT6 for Ethernet
        connections. Coax cables provide upstream as well as downstream signals for satellite and cable channels. The
        ethernet
        cables can support up to 100'] Mbps for the networking devices. While working with cables, make sure that you
        don’t
        dent, twist or change the cable’s shape.</p>

      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">One thing which you should always remember while looking for electrical wires is that
        they are always insulated, which
        is not the case with other types of wires.
        <strong>Electrical wires</strong>
        <em>are sometimes made from copper</em> because of the numerous advantages that copper offers. Other types of
        wires are
        usually
        <em>made from steel</em>. Insulation on the electric wire is essential to make sure that shocks and
        short-circuits do
        not take place between them.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">It is always wise to have a clear know-how of the exact type of application for which
        you require. Since there is a
        wide range of wires and cables which are available in the market, you will need to be specific when looking for
        them
        on Moglix. While looking for a cable, you may come across
        <strong>CCTV cables, telephone cables, computer cables</strong> etc. So, it would be better to opt for the exact
        type of
        cable which you require.</p>

      <ul class="no-padding majorpoints pad-lr-30">
        <li class="f-size-12 pad-tb-5">Electricians often join aluminum and copper wires with plastic wire caps. This is
          not a wise thing to do because
          of the difference in thermal expansion between the two types of wires and the number of junctions in the
          electrical
          distribution system.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12 pad-tb-5">Make it a point to have all connections in the panel as well as switches &amp;
          outlets are checked every year by
          a licensed electrician.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12 pad-tb-5">All the connections need to be secure. Unlabeled switches and receptacles are
          ideal for use only with copper. So,
          you will need to have these connecting devices changed from time to time.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12 pad-tb-5">All the wires which terminate at plugs, lights and switches need to be given an
          anti-oxidation paste as the coating.
