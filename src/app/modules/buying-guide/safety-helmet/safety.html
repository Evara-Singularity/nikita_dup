          protect the head from injuries which are caused by falling objects, debris, rain, electric shock etc</em>.
        People
        who are involved in industries such as
        <strong>real estate, petrochemicals and logistics
        </strong>
        <em>are exposed to these dangers on a regular basis.</em> The safety helmets that are used in factory settings
        these
        days come with a brushed cloth on foam and cross ventilation systems.
        <em>The triple configuration shells of the helmets ensure that they have a high impact resistant capacity.</em>
        Created
        from specially formulated polymers, they can be used for years together.</p>

      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">The different types of safety helmets are categorised according to their area
        of application. Some of them are mentioned

        <em>A person’s brain can be seriously injured by impact or through the head’s violent rotation of the head while
          the
          brain remains still, causing a jerk to nerves and blood vessels</em>. Internal blood vessels and nerves jerk
        various
        parts of the brain as well, thereby causing a lot of strain to vessels and nerves.
        <strong>Safety helmets
        </strong> are designed in order to handle major crash energy which contains a crushable foam layer.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Once the user crashes and hits a hard surface, that part of the helmet
        crushes, checking the crash energy and extending
        the wearer’s head’s stopping time by around six thousandths of a second (6 ms) to minimise peak impact to the
        brain.
        Internal strains and rotational forces are likely to be minimised by crushing.</p>
      <h4 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">
        <em>Safety helmets are usually of three types</em>-
        <strong>Class A</strong>,

          <strong>Class A helmets</strong> offer users with impact and penetration resistance apart from limited voltage
          protection
          (up to 2200 volts).
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-13 pad-tb-5">
          <strong>Class B helmets</strong> offer the best quality of protection against electrical hazards with
          high-voltage shock
          and burn protection. They also protect users from impact and penetration hazards caused by flying/falling
          objects.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-13 pad-tb-5">The
          <strong>class C helmets</strong> on the other hand offer lightweight comfort and impact protection. However,
          they cannot

      <ul class="no-margin no-padding pad-lr-15 mar-b-20">
        <li class="f-size-13 pad-tb-5">Safety helmets are used across a wide range of industries such as
          <strong>real estate, oil &amp; gas, iron, steel, metallurgy</strong> etc
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-13 pad-tb-5">The safety helmets that are produced in India adhere to all the specifications
          that are mentioned by the
          <em>Bureau of Indian Standards</em>. At present, it has become mandatory for business owners in many countries
          to equip their
          workers with safety helmets. It is important to maintain the receipts of safety helmets
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-13 pad-tb-5">Proper training to workers can help them to avert situations which could lead to
          head injuries. During training, workers
          come to know about the preventive measures for head injury, the importance of safety helmets, use of
          accessories and
          their attachment methods, care and maintenance
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-13 pad-tb-5">The use of safety helmets with chin straps is essential for people who are
          exposed to windy conditions or require bending
          frequently. Safety helmets need to be worn in a precise manner. During the summer, some industrial workers
          wear
          <strong>straw hats</strong> in between their head and safety helmets so as to minimise sunlight exposure.
          However, doing so will
          greatly reduce the protection level of safety helmets

        <li class="f-size-13 pad-tb-5">
          <em>A helmet’s durability can be extended through periodic cleaning and inspection</em>. You need to check the
          shell, suspension
          system and other parts of your helmet for holes, cracks, tears or other types of damages which can have a
          serious impact
          on the hat’s protective value. Paints and cleaning agents might weaken the shell of your helmet and also cause
          the elimination
          of electrical resistance.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-13 pad-tb-5">One wise thing that you can do is to get in touch with the helmet manufacturer to
          acquire details on the effects of paint
          and cleaning materials on their products.
          <em>Avoid drilling holes, applying labels or paints to protective headgear since this will have a negative
            impact on their
            protection.</em>
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-13 pad-tb-5">
          <em>The helmet should also be kept away from direct sunlight</em> as sunlight and extreme heat can cause
          considerable damage.
          In case the helmet which you have been using has problems such as cracking, perforation or deformity in its
          shell or
          brim the you will need to replace them.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-13 pad-tb-5">Other issues that may force you to replace the helmet includes sign of exposure
          of the shell or brim to UV light, chemicals
          or heat. A helmet which suffers an impact needs to be replaced, even if the damage isn’t easily visible to the
          naked
          eye. Suspension systems are sold as replacement parts and need to be changed when there is excessive wear or
          damage.
          You don’t need to replace the whole helmet if there is an issue with its suspension systems
