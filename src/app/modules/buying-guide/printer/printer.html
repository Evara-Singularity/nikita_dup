      <h2>What Are the Printers?</h2>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">A printer is a type of eternal hardware output device which is responsible
        for taking electronic data that has been
        stored in a computing device and is utilised to generate a hard copy of the data.
        <strong>
          <a href="{{API['BASE_URLS']['PROD']}}/office-supplies/office-machines/printers/214191500">Printers</a>
        </strong> are one of the most commonly used peripherals of computers which are used for printing texts and
        photos.</p>
    </div>

      <h2 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">What Are the Different Types of Printers?</h2>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Printers are primarily of four types –
        <strong>Impact Printers</strong>,
        <strong>Non-Impact Printers</strong>,
        <strong>photo printers </strong>and
        <strong> 3 D printers</strong>. The characteristics and features of these printers are mentioned below: -</p>

      <div class="wp-20 wp-xs-100  img">

          alt="Impact Printers">
      </div>
      <div class="wp-80 wp-xs-100 ">
        <h4>Impact Printers</h4>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10 max-w-500">These printers make a contact with paper. They normally form the
          print image by pressing an inked ribbon against
          the paper with the help of hammer or pins. The
          <strong>different types of dot matrix printers are
          </strong> mentioned below: -</p>
      </div>

      <div class="wp-20 wp-xs-100  img">
        <img class="border max-w-250" src="{{API['BASE_URLS']['IMAGE_BASE_URL']}}images/print/2.jpg"
          alt="Dot Matrix Printers">
      </div>
      <div class="wp-80 wp-xs-100 ">
        <h4>Dot Matrix Printers</h4>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10 max-w-500">This type of printer uses print heads that contain 9-24 pins.
          These pins produce patterns, dotted patterns on paper
          to create individual characters. The 24 pin dot-matrix printer produces more dots as compared to a 9 pin
          dot-matrix
          printer that results in a higher quality and clearer characters.
          <em>The rule of thumb is greater the number of pins, the clearer letters on paper</em>.</p>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10 max-w-500">The pins strike the ribbon individually since print mechanism
          moves across the entire print line in both directions
          i.e. from left to right, then right to left etc. The user can produce a colour output with a dot-matrix
          printer
          (the user will change the black ribbon with a ribbon which has colour stripes). These printers are inexpensive
          and normally print at a speed of 100-600 characters per second.</p>

      <div class="wp-80 wp-xs-100 ">
        <h4>Daisy Wheel Printers</h4>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10 max-w-500">Daisy wheel impact printers have a print mechanism similar to a
          daisy. It is also known as daisy-wheel printer since
          the print mechanism is similar to a daisy. A character is created at the end of each ‘’petal’’ in order to
          create
          a solid-line print. A hammer hits the petal containing a character against the ribbon which the character
          prints
          on paper. It speed is usually 25-55 characters per second.</p>

          alt="Line Printers">
      </div>
      <div class="wp-80 wp-xs-100 ">
        <h4>Line Printers</h4>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10 max-w-500">In businesses in which a huge amount of material is printed, the
          characters at a time are printed very slowly. So,
          line at a time printers are necessary. They use a special mechanism which can print a whole line at once. They
          can normally print in the range of 1200 to 6000 lines per minute. Drum, chain and band printers are all line
          at
          a time printer.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="wp-20 wp-xs-100  img">

          alt="Drum Printers">
      </div>
      <div class="wp-80 wp-xs-100 ">
        <h4>Drum Printers</h4>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10 max-w-500">A drum printer includes a solid, cylindrical drum which has
          raised characters in bands on its surface. The number
          of print positions across the drum equals to the number available on the page. It is usually between 80-132
          positions.
          The drum revolves at a quick speed. For each print position, there is a print hammer which is located behind
          the
          paper. The hammers strike the paper with the ink ribbon, against the proper character on the drum as it
          passes.</p>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10 max-w-500">One revolution of the drum is necessary for printing each line.
          Therefore, all characters on the line are not printed
          simultaneously. But the time needed for printing the whole line is front enough to call them line printers.
          The
          normal speeds of printers are between the range of 300 to 2000 lines per minute.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="wp-20 wp-xs-100  img">

      <div class="wp-80 wp-xs-100 ">
        <h4>Band Printers</h4>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10 max-w-500">A band printer functions in a way
          <em>similar to a chain printer</em> except that it utilises a band rather than a chain and has fewer hammers.
          A band
          printer is equipped with a steel band which is divided into five sections that have 48 characters each. The
          hammers
          on a band printer are mounted on a cartridge which moves across the paper to the suitable positions.
          Characters
          are rotated into place and are stuck by hammers. The font styles can be easily changed through replacement by
          a
          chain or band.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="wp-20 wp-xs-100  img">

          alt="Chain Printers">
      </div>
      <div class="wp-80 wp-xs-100 ">
        <h4>Chain Printers</h4>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10 max-w-500">A chain printer utilises a chain of print characters that are
          wrapped around two pulleys. As the drum printer, there
          is one hammer for print position. The circuitry within the printer detects once the correct character appears
          on
          the desired print location of the page.</p>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10 max-w-500">The hammer then strikes the page and presses the paper against a
          ribbon and character that is situated at a desired
          print position. The character leaves an impression on the page. The chain continues rotating till all the
          print
          positions on the line are filled. Then, the page moves up in order to print the next line. Their speed is
          normally
          between 400-2500 characters per minute.</p>

        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10 max-w-500">
          <em>If you require a printer which produces rich, detailed graphics or fresh text documents, an
            <strong>inkjet printer
            </strong> would be ideal for you</em>. These printers work by spraying minute ink droplets directly into
          paper.
          They are ideal for printing on different types of paper types and sizes like
          <em>labels, business envelopes, scrapbooking paper ad labels</em>. But, high quality printing requires
          variable print
          speeds. Therefore, this option is suitable for light printing needs that are used in homes and small
          businesses.
          <strong>All-in-one inkjet printers</strong> offer a convenient way for accessing numerous devices in a single
          space-saving
          unit.
          <strong>Inkjet printers</strong> available online are in
          <strong>two varieties
          </strong>- a
          <strong>3 in 1</strong> which enables you to print, copy and scan documents or a
          <strong>4-in-1</strong> which enables you to fax.</p>

          <em>Laser printers are specifically created for printing large volumes quickly and are available at low cost
            per page</em>.
          As in case of copy printers,
          <strong>laser printers</strong> utilise static electricity and toner powder instead of ink for transferring
          images and
          text into paper. Though high printing speeds and cost efficiency are the major advantages of laser printers,
          there
          are some other benefits also. Since the toner is already dry, you won’t have to wait for it to dry. It won’t
          smear
          on your paper. And if you are looking for versatility and convenience, opting for an
          <strong>all-in-one laser printer</strong> is a major option.

          <em>designed for creating high-quality photos</em> which compete with the ones you acquire from a cyber café,
          at a
          comparable or lower cost. One of major plus points of a photo printer is the convenience of printer photos
          immediately,

      <h2 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">How to Select the Best Printers?</h2>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">As in the case of any other computer peripheral, you need to be very
        selective while selecting printers. Here are some
        of the major areas which you will need to pay attention to while selecting printers online: -</p>
      <h4 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Displays</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Quite a few personal printers and business printers have small displays on
        their front panels to help you choose menu
        options or for communicate printer status. Though the typical display can include one or two lies of character
        based
        messages, higher -end and photo oriented printers can have a full-colour LCD with touch capability. Normally it
        is
        better to have any type of display, rather than mysterious, blinking lights. The Samsung printers which we have
        as
        a part of our collection have a speed of 43 ppm and consume a limited amount of power.</p>
      <h4 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Paper Handling</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Normally, both inkjet and laser printers print on letter and legal size
        paper. They come with input and output trays
        which can hold at least 100 sheets of paper. Printers with manifold paper trays can hold far more pages, which
        will
        help in reducing the frequency of tray refilling. There are a number of ways that printers can move through the
        feed.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">A number of them draw paper from the printer’s front using rubber rollers for
        guiding the paper out of the tray though
        the printer. In contrast, top-load printers use gravity for moving the paper down through the feeder and out
        from the
        printer’s front. This is a good option if you are sure that you will be printing on stiff media or other types

      <h4 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Printer Speed</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">While shopping for a printer, you might come across some terms which indicate
        output speed.
        <strong>PPM (pages per minute)</strong> sometimes called
        <strong>CPM (copies per minute)</strong>, decides how many pages per minute your printer can thrust.
        <em>The higher the number of pages printed, the faster the print can copy or print your document.</em> If you
        are shopping
        for a
        <strong>photo printer</strong>, you will come across the term
        <strong>IPM (images per minute)</strong> which goes by the same principle.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <em>Our range of Xerox printers have a high printer speed</em>. They come with interesting features such as

      <h2 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">How to Maintain Printers?</h2>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Anytime you need to open a printer to maintain,
        <em>turn off its power and keep your hands away from hot fusers and moving parts within the printer</em>. It
        will check
        the unnecessary damage to both you as well as your printer. Here are some maintenance tips that can help you
        take optimum
        care of your computer: -</p>
      <h4 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Stay Safe</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Each time you require opening the computer for maintenance,
        <strong>turn off its power</strong>.
        <em>Keep your hands away from hot fusers and moving within the printer</em>. It will ensure that neither you or
        your printer
        suffer from any type of damage.</p>
      <h4 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Clean Dust and Debris from The Printer</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">The
        <em>build-up of toner, dust and other debris within the printer might lead to jams</em>, causing streaks of ink
        to appear
        on papers. A proper fix is to remove particles using a small vacuum. It is preferred over use of canned air
        dusters
        since it removes dust instead of spraying it around its interiors. You can still go further by using a cotton
        swab
        and pure water to wash and cleanse the ink cartridges. Most of the manufacturers offer specific instructions
        either
        in their printer manual or online. Make it a point to read them since there are some parts of the
        <a
          href="{{API['BASE_URLS']['PROD']}}/office-supplies/computer-supplies/toner-cartridges/214132000">cartridge</a>
        which you didn’t gauze.</p>
      <h4 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Fix Mechanical Errors Carefully</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Like other peripherals, your printer will last longer if you take its proper
        care. A mistakenly resolved paper jam might
        lead to printing problems in the future. Instead of venting your frustration on the printer, use the
        instructions which
        come with the printer to find out the best way to fix a jam on your specific model. Usually, the most common
        practice
        is to utilise both hands in order to pull out the jammed paper slowly. It will help you ensure that there is no
        internal
        damage to the printer. You can also check jams by ensuring that the paper you load within the printer isn’t
        torn, stuck
        together and dog eared and that the tray isn’t overfilled.</p>
      <h4 class="f-size-18  mar-t-20">Buy A Maintenance Kit</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <em>If you are willing to invest a little amount of money to extend your printer’s lifespan, buy a maintenance
          kit from
          the printer’s manufacturer</em> when the original parts start showing signs of wear out. The kit will include
        a wide
        range of maintenance products ranging from cleaning supplies to changeable printer parts like rollers, which
        when dirty
        or worn out are the major cause of printer jams. No printer is flawless and there can be occasional jams, errors
        and
        smudges. However, easy printer maintenance it is possible to minimise the recurrence of these issues and ensure
        a better
        printing experience.</p>
