      <h2>What Are Diagnostic Instruments?</h2>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Medical equipment are those devices that are used in order to diagnose the health
        parameters of a person. The effectiveness
        of these devices makes it possible to detect illnesses at an early stage, thereby ensuring that the treatment
        can
        start on time. From checking normal fever to performing
        <strong>blood sugar test</strong>, these devices are indispensable for patients as well as doctors. The accuracy
        of these
        devices play a major role in detecting any illness at an early stage and in ensuring early cure.

            [routerLink]="['/medical-supplies/diagnostic-instruments/115250000']">Diagnostic instruments</a>
        </strong>are of different types.
        <em>These instruments are used for measuring vital signs of a patient such as blood pressure, ECG, dissolved
          gasses in
          the blood and EEG. They are used for blood testing, genes, urine etc
        </em>.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">You can also use diagnostic medical equipment at home to maintain a record of your
        blood pressure and sugar level.
        <strong>Medical imaging machines</strong> such as
        <em>CT scan machines, ultra sound machines and MRI machines which help in taking pictures of body organs provide
          a clear
          image of the affected body organ</em>. The usage of diagnostic instruments is therefore of paramount
        importance.

      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">The vast diversity of these devices further complicates the selection process. To make
        the buying process a smooth
        and less time consuming one for our patients, we have divided the category on the basis of
        <a class="text-blue f-size-13" [routerLink]="['/medical-supplies/diagnostic-instruments/115250000']">diagnostic
          tools</a>. Therefore, while buying them, you will need to keep in mind the exact area of the body where
        it will be applied during the treatment process. Here are some steps that you can adopt while buying different
        types
        of diagnostic devices: -</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18 b-text mar-t-20">Thermometers</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">While
        <strong>buying multipurpose thermometers</strong>, you will need to check the body temperature with a sensor
        which is normally
        found in a small metal tip on one end. Using this

        </a>, it is possible to measure a child’s temperature orally, rectally, or under the arm.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Thermometers are either made from glass or are digital. These are the most affordable
        type of thermometers and offer
        highly accurate readings. While using ear thermometers, doctors apply an infrared ray in order to measure the
        temperature
        within an infant’s ear canal. They offer quick results and are safe but are not highly comfortable. Using them
        is
        also tougher as compared to other thermometers since they need to be inserow bg-white pad-tb-15d in a perfect
        manner
        so as to make accurate, consistent readings. They are ideal for children who are 6 months or older.
      </p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <strong>Mercury thermometers </strong>are one of the most common types of thermometers. In this thermometer, a
        glass tube
        is filled with mercury and a standard temperature scale marked on the tube. Due to temperature changes, mercury
        expands
        and contracts. You can read the temperature from scale. These thermometers are commonly used in homes and are
        made
        from glass of the straw size and have a silvery-white liquid inside them. They are mostly used in homes, schools
        and hospitals.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18 b-text mar-t-20">Stethoscopes</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">The
        <strong>Littmann stethoscope</strong> is one of the most commonly used stethoscopes in the world. These
        stethoscopes have
        an ergonomic design and are manufactured using the ‘tunable technology’ in the diaphragm. So users can hear low
        as
        well as high frequency sounds just by applying pressure to it. They come with tight, soft sealing ear tips which
        ensure sound transmission to be made through anatomically designed headsets. They comfortably fit within the
        user’s
        ear canal.
        <em>Littmann stethoscope price tends to vary according to model.
        </em>
      </p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18 b-text mar-t-20">Blood Pressure Monitors</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Blood pressure monitors or checker that are meant for domestic use normally come with a
        middle-sized cuff. So, the
        cuff size is the most important area to which users need to pay attention. Choosing a
        <strong>
          <a class="text-blue f-size-13"
            [routerLink]="['/measurement-testing/diagnostic-instruments/blood-pressure-monitors/115251100']">BP check
            machine</a>
        </strong> of the wrong size will cause inaccuracies in blood pressure. Therefore, users will need to measure the
        upper arm
        at the midpoint between the shoulder and elbow before selecting a cuff size. Check the clinical validation of
        these
        devices is essential for the blood pressure monitors that are to be used in hospitals and clinics. Digital
        monitors
        that come with the ‘clinically validated’ tag should be given precedence.
      </p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">The
        <strong>blood pressure measurement machine</strong> which you buy will need to be
        <em>clinically validated by the Indian Medical Association and international bodies such as Association for the
          Advancement
          for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation and International Protocol for the Validation of Automated BP
          Measuring
          Devices
        </em>. The monitor should also satisfy the buyer’s special needs, especially if it is meant for use by the
        elderly,
        pregnant women or children. Children or senior citizens who have smaller or larger than average-sized arms
        require
        special-sized cuffs. They are normally available in pharmacies. You will need to take a measurement of your
        upper
        arm and select a monitor that comes with the proper cuff size.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18 b-text mar-t-20">Pulse Oximeters</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">A good knowledge of

        </strong>
        is essential, both for doctors as well as patients. Since an oximeter is a highly versatile device, the user
        needs to have
        a clear perception of the exact reason for usage. Pulse oximeters are of different types such as
        <strong>table tops with sensors</strong>,
        <strong>wrist-worn sensors, handheld oximeter</strong> and
        <strong>portable oximeter
        </strong>. They are small, have a rectangular shape and are clipped on the finger. The display screen is visible
        on the probe itself. It needs to be battery operated. They are commonly used in order to find oxygen saturation
        by
        clinicians, patients as well as caregivers.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">The
        <strong>handheld oximeter</strong> on the other hand are
        <em>used by hospitals and medical institutes because of their higher level of accuracy</em>. In these devices,
        the probe
        is connected to the screen which is connected to a cable. To acquire a good reading, the probe will need to be
        attached
        to the user’s index finger.
        <em>These oximeters are highly reliable for spot checks and daily oxygen monitoring</em>. Therefore, it is ideal
        for
        people who require continuous monitoring due because of a long-term illness require a model which is suitable
        for
        constant use.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">If you need it to check your oxygen level periodically, then a small clip-oximeter
        would be the primary option. In
        case a doctor wants to measure a patient’s heart rate, then he will need to look for a model which comes with a
        heart
        rate monitor. For patients, prior consultation with their doctor is essential before buying an oximeter.
      </p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18 b-text mar-t-20">Glucometers</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">There are numerous factors that have to be kept in mind while buying

        glucometers
        more easily as compared to others. The testing procedures of these devices tend to vary for each meter. Some
        require
        more work to be done as compared to others. Important considerations that need to be made includes the amount of
        blood the test strip requires, the time it takes for reading and the clarity of numbers that are visible on
        screen.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>One major aspect that needs to paid attention to is the ability of a glucometer to store the readings</em>.
        Since
        <em>tracking these numbers is essential for long-term care, maintaining a record is most important</em>. It can
        save
        them from a lot of hassles such as writing down the numbers in a notebook or diary. So, their main aim should be
        look for a meter which comes with memory options. There are a number of models to create logs that can retrieve
        past
        readings at a later time.
        <em>The latest versions of glucometers create a downloadable file which is in sync with computers</em>. They can
        thus
        be emailed to doctors.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <strong>Wrist worn sensors</strong> are wireless and are used for daily monitoring. They can also be used while
        the patient
        is asleep, which makes it an ideal model.
        <em>It is designed like a wristwatch</em>, has a small wire that connects the probe, and needs to be placed on

      <ul class="no-padding pad-lr-30 majorpoints">
        <li class="f-size-12 pad-tb-10">
          <strong>Construction- </strong>Check the construction of high-density materials like titanium or stainless
          steel. The harder
          materials can conduct sound in comparison to softer, more porous metals like aluminum. Moreover, a chest piece
          not only comes with a hand-polished finish on the outside as well as outside is exemplary. An incomplete chest
          piece which internally has perforations which can absorb sound, as in case of a ceiling. A chest piece with an
          incomplete finishing internally has perforations that can absorb sound as case of ceilings. A hand-polished
          and
          smooth chest piece provides a clearer and accurate sound.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12 pad-tb-10">
          <strong>Headset- </strong> Ideally the headset needs to be of the same high-density material as in case of
          chest piece
          and needs to be angled at 15° as a standard. Apart from the highest sealing and sound on the chest piece for
          the
          same quality metals in order to transmit sounds to the headset. Caution needs to be maintained while checking
          the
          materials that are used on both headset and chest piece. This is because in most of the cases, you will need
          to
          look at the description of your stethoscope that might include the material of the chest piece.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12 pad-tb-10">
          <strong>Diaphragm- </strong>Look for a high-quality and strong diaphragm. It would be wise to keep an extra
          case in case
          of a puncture or other mishaps.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12 pad-tb-10">
          <strong>Tubing- </strong>First and foremost, you need to select a stethoscope that comes with a thick and
          durable tubing
          to isolate acoustics from external noise in order protect the sound. Thin or tubing that are prone breakage
          might
          lead to loss of sound. A number of tubes would be more longer than others in order to maintain a safer
          distance
          from patient to physician. Sounds can be modulated with longer tubing. Therefore, to find a stethoscope and
          can
          make up for the length with chest pieces, headsets that are made using quality materials.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12 pad-tb-10">
          <strong>Ear Trips- </strong>Often people think that ear tips are like an afterthought while selecting a
          stethoscope. In
          reality, they are essential while selecting a stethoscope. But in reality they are highly vital to offer
          accurate
          readings. Ear tips need to fit in a safe and comfortable manner and are preferably offered in different sizes
          of
          comfort. Apart from the comfort factor, it also needs to create a seal inside the patient’s ear so as to
          prevent
          external sound from seeping through. For ear tips, size and materials are the most important factor which you
          need
          to keep in mind.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12 pad-tb-10">
          <strong>Stem- </strong> Even a slight issue in the stethoscope’s stem can create a lot of difference. In order
          to get the
          best quality of sound experience, you should look for a stem which is constructed in the same quality as its
          chest
          piece. Therefore, you should not overlook this minute detail. This great stem is designed with precision and
          needs
          to ‘’snap’’ within place in order to minimize sound leakage.

      <h2 class="f-size-18 b-text">How to Take Care of Diagnostic Instruments?</h2>
      <h3 class="f-size-18 b-text mar-t-20">Stethoscopes</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Stethoscopes can be damaged by extreme temperatures and with time face problems with
        tubing. Therefore, you will need
        to leave that scope in extreme heat or cold over extended periods of time. Exposing them to oils or solvents
        might
        cause damage to tubes and chest pieces. Exposure to sunlight can cause considerable damage to the tubes, retain
        rings
        diaphragms on the stethoscope. Therefore, they need to be kept at a place where it will be exposed to direct
        sunlight
        over long periods of time. When your stethoscopes become dirty, you will need to wipe it down mild soapy water.
        They
        need to be kept dry after cleaning., before being wiped down with a 70% isopropyl alcohol solution for low level
        disinfection. The ear tips on the stethoscope need to be removed by unscrewing them from binaurals. This will
        enable
        thorough cleaning to be done.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18 b-text mar-t-20">Blood Pressure Monitors</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">As blood pressure monitor works automatically, it will need to be re-calibrated at
        least every two years to acquire
        the best results. To re-calibrate your automatic home monitor, send it back to the manufacturer. Companies
        usually
        perform recalibration for a fee.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18 b-text mar-t-20">Oximeters</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>A pulse oximeter requires routine maintenance and tests to maintain their accuracy</em>. Check it to ensure
        that
        the device is clean and decontaminated. Therefore, check whether there is any type of physical damage to the
        display,
        case, mounts or components. The switches and controls need to be operated and aligned correctly. Find out if the
        control numbers, warnings and labels are present. If they do, find out whether they are legible or not. Check
        the
        inlets, hoses and power cord and find out whether they are functioning properly or not. Ensure that both filters
        and vents are clean.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18 b-text mar-t-20">Thermometers</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>Clean your thermometer after exposure too dirty, dusky, humid and smoky conditions.</em> Regular cleaning is
        essential
        in every six months. Utilize a soft cloth or cotton swab with media or medical alcohol. But don’t use soap or
        chemicals.
        Wipe the lens carefully first and then body of the thermometer. Let the lens dry fully before using the
        thermometer.
        But don’t immerse any part of the thermometer. Store thermometer between 40°F and 149°F (4-65°C). Store the
        thermometer
        in a place which is not exposed to extreme temperature.</p>
      <h3 class="f-size-18 b-text mar-t-20">Glucometers</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">As in case of other medical devices,
        <em>glucometers need regular maintenance to function properly</em>. Since your treatment depends of readings of
        a glucose
        machine,
        <strong>proper maintenance of a glucometer is must to ensure accuracy in blood glucose values</strong>. Here are
        some steps
        that you can take to make sure that proper care of glucometer:</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <strong>Daily cleaning-</strong> A number of glucometers come with lens that are streaked with blood and oil
        from dust and
        fingers. Avoid using alcohol since it can damage the glucometer. Rather use plain water or special cleaner which
        is suitable for cleaning sensitive equipment. Use a soft cloth to gently to wipe and clean the affected area.
      </p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Once cleaning is done, check all parts to find whether they are neat. Also verify
        whether there is any physical damage
        to the case, display, mounts, components or cart. The switches and controls need to be operable and perfectly
        aligned.
        Find out whether the control numbers, warnings and labels are present. At the next step check the hoses and
        inlets
        to find out if the power cord and charger are functioning properly or not. Last but not the least, check both
        filters
        and vents to be sure that they are clean.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <strong>Change batteries periodically- </strong>The glucometer might not signal when batteries are getting low.
        You may also
        get skewed readings before you come across a low battery message. Therefore, learn to use the glucometer and
        make
        it a habit to change its battery from time to time. You can also keep a spare set of batteries in case you want
        a
        last minute testing to be done.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <strong>Performing Controls- </strong>This is the most effective way to check whether the glucometer functions
        properly or
        not. When you buy the device, you will be offered a control solution. Utilize the solution like a blood sample
        and
        compare its reading with the desired range on the control packaging. If you find that the control is out of
        range,
        shake the solution in a better manner, clean the lens, or replace your batteries.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <strong>Utilize the Check Strip or Key- </strong>Once you open a new bottle or test strip, don’t forget to use
        the check
        strip or key to set your glucometer’s code.
        <strong>Conduct electrical safety checks- </strong>Performing electrical safety checks will help you detect
        resistance and
        chassis leakage. Also perform a patient lead leakage current isolation test and insulation tests. All these
        tests
        should be conducted according to set parameters.
      </p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Acquiring a clear perception of the above mentioned points will make it easier for you
        to compare and choose best diagnostic
        instruments for your needs.</p>
