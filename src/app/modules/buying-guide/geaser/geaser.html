      <h2 class="f-size-18 b-text">What Are Geysers?</h2>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <strong>The geysers</strong>&nbsp;are electronic devices which are utilised primarily for water heating purpose.
        They are
        very useful for heating water as the rattling of teeth and the shivering body can only be stopped by a warm,
        relaxing
        bath. That's where our hero, "geysers" comes in.&nbsp;
        <strong>
          Geysers
        </strong> are widely used within
        <em>bathrooms, kitchens, and showers for heating water within homes.</em> They can be easily installed, are
        user-friendly
        and can be used by people of any age groups. Taking cold showers is an uncomfortable experience for kids and
        elderly
        women. Simultaneously sleeping during winter night under blankets while shivering isn’t a pleasurable experience
        either. To resolve these issues, Moglix presents a wide range of geysers to keep users warm and cosy.</p>

            </a>
          </strong>
          <em>are user-friendly and don’t need any installation process</em>. In order to heat water, you will only
          <em>need to dip the device in a metal bucket fall of water</em> and put on the switch.
          <strong>It takes 10-15 minutes to heat a bucket of water</strong>. It contains a heating coil and a chord
          which resembles
          an electronic iron. In order to use the
          <strong>immersion heater rod</strong>, you will only need to fill a water bucket and place it within the
          bucket directly
          or with the help of a cloth hanger. Then, connect the plug into the socket and switch it on. A few models come
          with an indicator to show that they are functioning well.</p>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Unlike costly geysers, immersion rods are not equipped with an auto-off
          system. So when the bucket is warm enough,
          you can manually switch off the system. As in the case of geysers, immersion heaters without sufficient or no
          water will burn the coil ad make it useless. Therefore, opt for a high-quality immersion heater from a reputed
          brand to avoid electric shocks and discomfort both to you and your family members.</p>

      <h4 class="mar-top">Tank Type Water Heaters</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <strong>Tank type water heaters</strong>
        <em>are normally used in homes</em>. They have a large, cylindrical tank standing on the end with pipes that are
        attached
        to them. If you don’t have a tank but have a hot-water heating system for heating, it’s possible that hot water
        reaching
        your tap will be heated by the boiler. In other circumstances, hot water can be supplied by a stand-alone
        instantaneous
        water heater which is mounted near the fixture it serves. The normal water heaters are of two types- Electric
        and
        Fuel-Fired. In the case of the latter, the fuel normally used in gas, either propane or natural.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <strong>Fuel-fired units</strong>
        <em>come with a vent pipe at the top for carrying away exhaust gasses</em>. In contrast,
        <strong>electric models</strong>
        <em>are only equipped with a power cable which connects the heater to the electric service panel.</em> At
        Moglix, we
        are offering water heaters from brands such as
        <strong>
          Eveready
        </strong>,
        <strong>
          Marc
        </strong>,
        <strong>
          Bajaj
        </strong>,
        <strong>
          Venus
        </strong>
        etc. The primary task of the tank-type heater is not only for heating the water but also storing it till it’s
        ready for usage.
        Additionally, all tanks are equipped with insulation for maintaining the warmth of water during heating rounds.
        The
        upper part of every tank is equipped with a water supply and delivery pipes. The supply pipe water moves cold
        water
        to the bottom of the tank through the dip tube. The hot-water delivery pipe takes water from the top.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <strong>To ensure safety, all water heaters have a T &amp; P valve</strong> (
        <em>temperature and pressure relief valve</em>). The valve opens if either the temperature or pressure of water
        exceeds
        a safety limit. The valve is connected to a pipe which runs outside the tank and ends 6 inches from the floor.
        It’s
        wise to keep a bucket under the pipe end to catch water if the valve opens. The T &amp; P valve shouldn’t be
        connected
        to a drain. In case the valve did open, there is a sign that such an issue within the water heater.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Most of the tanks are made from steel and are glass-lined in the interior to
        check corrosion. Corrosion is the major
        reason why tanks fail. Once the rust creates a hole, there are momentary fixes. However, the tank needs to be
        replaced
        in the long run. All tanks are equipped with an anode rod for controlling corrosion. The tanks are protected by
        the
        magnesium anode rod by corroding the tank in place of steel. Since the rod is designed to corrode, it will
        eventually
        wear away.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Once this happens, the corrosion of steel will speed up. It’s wise to check
        the anode rod once annually and replace
        it if is necessary. At the bottom of the tank, there is a drain cock for an emptying heater. The valve on supply
        pipe enables you to shut down the hot-water plumbing without affecting the home’s cold-water supply.

        <h4>Electrical Water Heaters</h4>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
          <strong>Electric water heaters</strong> are normally wired to a 220-volt circuit. On heating the water, the
          current passes
          through electrical resistance heating elements-normally two, one in the middle of the tank and the other at
          the
          bottom. Power is delivered to each element through a thermostat-a switch senses the water temperature. Once
          the
          temperature drops, the switch closes to allow current to flow. It opens once the temperature reaches its
          stipulated
          limit.</p>

            geyser water heaters

          </strong> are vertically mounted. Vertical water heaters require at least two feet of vertical height on the
          wall. In case

        <h4>Fuel-Fired Water Heaters</h4>
        <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Rather than using heat resistant elements, gas-fired heaters are equipped
          with a gas-fed burner through a control
          valve and a thermostat switch. In an oil-fired heater, the burner is similar to the one used in an oil
          furnace.
          In both the cases, the burner is normally located at a location for throwing a flame under the tank. The
          exhaust
          gasses are released either through a hollow core at the tank’s center or around its sides. Since fuel-fired
          heaters
          heat the tank, which in turn heats the water. As a result, there will be more wear and tear on the tank than
          with electric heat. Fuel-hired heaters, therefore, have a shorter durability as compared to an electric
          heater.</p>

          is most suitable if you reside in a
          high-rise building.
          <em>Geysers for high-rise buildings need to have a minimum pressure of more than 6 bars and an essential
            geyser pressure
            control valve.</em> Geyser pressure control valve releases much water pressure on geyser tank for avoiding
          geyser tank breakage. Glass-lined coated inner tanks are more suitable since they will resist high pressure.

      <h3 class="mar-top">Geysers</h3>
      There are numerous types of tank geysers. Some of them are mentioned below: -
      <h4 class="mar-top">Storage/Tanker Geyser</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <em>A storage/tanker is a tank which is used for storing hot water</em>. There are different sizes of tank
        measures in
        liters. You will need to decide on the capacity based on the usage.
        <em>These geysers are normally big in size and require more space for installation</em>.</p>

      <h4 class="mar-top">Gas Geysers</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <em>This type of geysers is cheaper as compared to electronic geysers but they need to very careful about

          gas leakage</em>. While using geysers, there is no need for water storage. Solar geysers prove to be quite
        cheaper
        in the long run but include high investments in the long run.</p>
      <h3 class="mar-top">How Do Electronic Geysers Work?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="pad-tb-20 card">
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <em>Geysers have three major components</em>-
        <strong>Heating Element</strong>,
        <strong>Water Tanks</strong>, and
        <strong>Thermostats</strong>. Each of these components is explained below: -</p>
      <h4 class="mar-top">Geyser Heating Element</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <em>The heating element is a vital component of the geyser</em>, apart from the container or inner tank.
        Therefore,
        you will need to inspect the quality of the geyser element. Extremely hard and very soft water affects heating
        elements, like the inner tank. The geyser’s heating elements are coated with a glass lining which is high
        effective
        for checking scaling. It also increases the durability of the geysers.</p>
      <h4 class="mar-top">Geyser Water Tanks</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <em>Geyser tanks hold hot water</em>. Therefore, tanks need to be corrosion resistant and strong.
        <strong>There are two types of Geyser water tanks: -</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>The older models</strong> are made from stainless steel and have become obsolete now. Corrosion and
          hard water
          scaling are the major problems with these water tanks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>
            <strong>Vitreous enamel glass coated</strong> geyser water tanks</em> are the latest models in geyser
          technology. During
          the manufacturing process, the stainless steel water tank is coated with advanced polymers to make the tank
          corrosion
          resistant. This mixture is known as Vitreous Enamel glass coated geyser water tank. They are corrosion
          resistant
          and can help in hard water scaling also.
          <em>Vitreous Enamel water tanks usually come with 5-7 years’ warranty also</em>. It is quite similar to glass
          lined
          coating.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="mar-top">Geyser Thermostat</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <strong>The geyser thermostat is the operating system of a geyser</strong>.
        <em>It decides when to start and stop the heating of water.</em> A bimetallic strip is utilised for converting a
        temperature
        change into mechanical displacement. The bimetallic strip is made from steel and copper. The thermostat is a
        wrapper
        on this strip which takes the action on the bimetallic strip response. A high-quality thermostat protects the
        geyser
        from overheating of water. It also helps in saving power consumption to an extent, but partially. Users normally
        have a misconception that they do not need to switch off the geyser because they have a thermostat. The
        thermostat
        has a temperature range between 30-60 ℃ for heating water.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Thermostats have a dial to set the maximum water temperature-usually between
        130 ℉ or as low as 120 ℉ for higher
        energy savings and scald protection. Once a hot-water tap is opened, cold water enters the tank through the dip
        tube and drops in temperature initiates the thermostat at element at the bottom. As water at the tank’s top is
        substituted by cool water, the temperature at the thermostat top drops and exits. Once the tap is turned off,
        the
        heating elements continue carrying currents till the thermostats are satisfied.</p>
      <h3 class="mar-top">Effectiveness of A Geyser</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Since water heaters heat as well as store water, the rate of water heating
        and capacity of the tank affects the supply
        of water at your fittings.
        <em>The speed at which the water heats is known as its recovery rate.</em>
        Once you draw water faster than it is heated, there is a drop in temperature. However, since the tank stores hot
        water, its
        capacity also affects the constant water availability at the tap.</p>
      <h3 class="mar-top">How to Select Geysers?</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <em>Selecting a water heater with proper capacity and recovery rate depends on the level of your water usage and
          how
          your unit heats the water</em>. Typically, heaters with low recovery rates are equipped with a high tank
        capacity.
        Though it takes longer to heat the water, there is more of it for periodic use. Electric heaters fall within
        this
        category. I contrast, a fuel-hired heater with a high recovery rate doesn’t require a large tank since it can
        heat
        water quickly. Normally electric models have the lowest recovery rate. In contrast, oil-fired units have the
        highest.</p>
      <strong>
        <em>Here are some of the major factors you should pay attention to while selecting a water heater/geyser: -</em>

          <strong>The volume of hot water being used-</strong> This is the major driving factor of electricity
          consumption by water
          heaters. The greater the amount of hot water you utilise, the greater the electricity it will consume.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The temperature of water used for bathing-</strong> This is different from thermostat temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Tap(Input)water temperature- </strong>Regions with colder climates need far more heating as compared
          to places
          with warmer climates. A water heater in Himachal Pradesh will require far more electricity than its
          counterpart
          in Kerala.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Thermostat temperature-</strong> The thermostat temperature by default is set at about 60 ° C for most
          water
          heaters. Some water heaters provide external control to change the settings as well.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Standing Losses-</strong> Water heaters don’t lose heat since it is calculated as standing loss. It is
          the heat
          lost through the water heater’s surface. BEE (Bureau of Energy Efficiency) describes standing losses as the
          energy
          consumption of a filled water heater post steady-state conditions have been reached when water isn’t drawn.
          The
          quality of the material is a major factor necessary for making the water heater. Water heaters from leading
          brands
          are of high quality and therefore they are preferred. BEE rates only branded water heaters.

      <h4 class="mar-top">How Much Water is Required by The Family?</h4>
      <strong>A guideline is mentioned below: -
      </strong>
      <ul>
        <li>For bathing, utilise bucket water. Each person requires 15 liters per bath. If you have a family, then add
          15 liters
          per bucket.
        </li>
        <li>For taking a bath using shower-25 liters/per person per bath.</li>
        <li>To wash clothes-10 liters/person per day.</li>
        <li>To wash utensils-5 liters/person per meal.</li>
        <li>What is the ideal temperature for bathing?</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">Though most water heaters have a thermostat setting of 60 ℃. But water at 60
        ℃ is far too lethal for the human body
        and can cause first-degree burns. The normal human body temperature is 37℃ and any temperature above it will
        make
        you feel hot. If you boil water at 46 ℃, you will have to add extra cold water to make it bearable.

      <h3 class="mar-top">Will All Water Heaters Consume Ideal Units of Electricity?</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <strong>No!</strong>
        <em>The amount of water calculated above are ideal and not actual units</em>. The actual units depend on the
        water
        heater size, standing losses and the way you utilise it. The greater the size of a water heater the higher will
        be the losses since it will cover a greater surface area.
        <em>Normally 100-liters’ water heaters have a standing loss greater than 1 unit per day. 70 liters’ water
          heaters have
          a standing loss close to 0.9 units per day</em>. The lesser the size of the water heater, the lesser will be
        the standing loss.
      </p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">If the water heater is kept on throughout the day, you will surely lose the
        full standing loss units in a day. One
        way of minimising it is by heating the amount of water you require and switching the water heater on before use
        usage. Make sure that it is switched off after use. Ensure that there is no wastage of any extra hot water since
        that is a waste of electricity.</p>

      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">
        <em>A geyser’s ideal size needs to be close to the volume of hot water necessary at one go</em>. If your water
        heater
        is connected with 2 bathrooms, then the ideal size is 50 liters. Ideally, sized heat generators are the ones

        <em>It’s wise to avoid calling a local plumber for installation if he doesn’t follow the best practices and
          safety
          guidelines</em>. Instead, install the geyser with the help of an authorised service center. Most geyser
        manufacturers
        offer installation service. You will require some additional thigs such as two steel ribbed pipes, one angle
        valve
        brass, a single connection nipple and another staff.</p>

      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">One vital factor which you will need to keep in mind while selecting a geyser
        is its wattage.
        <em>A geyser’s wattage makes it faster or slower</em>. The water heats quickly if you use an immediate geyser of
        4.5
        kW instantaneous geyser unlike a geyser of 2 kW. In some instances, 4.5 kW instantaneous geysers can save
        electricity
        and heat water required for bathing by ending the wastage of more hot water.</p>

      <h2 class="f-size-18 b-text mar-t-15">How to Reduce Geyser Electricity Consumption?</h2>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22 pad-tb-10">While buying a geyser, you need to check
        <strong>BEE (Bureau of Energy Efficiency)</strong> star ratings and opt for the best-rated geysers. Here are
        some useful
        geyser usage guidelines: -</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Standing Losses</strong> - Standing losses refer to the heat lost through the geyser’s surface.
          Geysers lose
          heat which is regarded as standing losses.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The volume of utilised hot water heater</strong> – This is the main motivating factor of a geyser’s
          usage of
          power. The greater the amount of hot water you use, the more will be the power usage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The temperature of the Geyser Thermostat </strong>- It is determined by default which set to around 60
          ℃ for
          most of the available geysers. However, a number of geysers come with an external control for modifying the
          setting.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Temperature of Water Utilised for Bathing </strong>- Your level of geyser electricity consumption
          is also
          determined by water’s temperature that is used for bathing. It is quite different from a thermostat’s
          temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Input Water Temperature</strong> - Input water temperature is determined by location. Areas with
          colder weather
          need more electricity as compared to places with a warm climate.
