      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>Plumbing is a system that carries fluids for different types of applications such as removal of wastes,
          heating &amp;
          cooling and delivery of portable pipes</em>. Plumbing involves the use of
        <strong>plumbing fixtures
        </strong>,
        <strong>tanks</strong>,

        using
        plumbing fittings. However certain plumbing issues such as problems with water heater can be fixed by
        professionals
        alone.

            number of them are equipped with filters and pumps. Some models are completely, while others are only partly
            covered from elements. Each of the variations play a specific role in rainwater harvesting. Cisterns that
            come
            without a cover are ideal for collecting the maximum number of rainwater. However, mosquitoes and algae can
            accumulate on cisterns which could cause harmful diseases to humans. A cistern of high quality can thus be
            a great asset to your home.

      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">For a plumber or any home based user, the tools to opt for depends on his necessity and
        skillsets. Here are some tips
        using which you can buy different types of plumbing fittings: -</p>
      <h4 class="mar-top">Bathroom Fittings
      </h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Bathroom fittings can help you make an instant impression on visitors.
        <em>Bathroom fittings are of different types such as chrome, brass, gold, nickel and stainless steel</em>.
        However, the
        most widely used tap styles are lever taps and crosshead. Therefore, if you want to give your bathrooms a modern
        look, then crosshead and lever taps would be the ideal types of fittings to go for.</p>
      <h3 class="mar-top">Faucets</h3>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>Selecting faucets is sometimes a tough challenge because of the presence of a wide range of designs that are
          available
          in the market</em>. Apart from style, configuration and type of finishing, the purpose for which you use the
        bathroom
        and sink configuration are important factors that you will need to pay attention to.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>While selecting faucets</em>, you will need to select faucets ad sinks together or ensure that the faucet is
        adaptable
        with your existing sink or not. Opt for a faucet according to your bathroom size. Occasionally, your ordered
        items
        may incur lead time before delivery. Therefore, consider this in your planning schedule. All faucets do not come
        with handles. A number of them are sold separately. The faucets that come with darker finishes can easily show
        soaps
        and cleaning residues.</p>
      <h4 class="mar-top">Showers</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">While selecting a shower, you will need to consider whether the shower model you are
        adopting will match well with
        your plumbing system or not. Shower systems are of different types-
        <strong>electric, digital, water saving airdrop, power showers, thermostatic showers and manual mixer
          showers</strong>. You
        will have to consider the various functionalities of your shower system as there are many shower handsets and
        heads
        that ca be either single or multifunctional.</p>
      <ul class="no-padding pad-lr-30">
        <li class="f-size-12">A
          <strong>manual mixer shower</strong> is a type of shower system which is the most commonly used. The shower
          draws water
          from existing hot &amp; cold water supplies and then mixed within the unit. Mixer showers are available in a
          deck
          mounted unit with an integrated shower handset. You can attach it to the bathroom wall using a rail &amp;
          bracket.
          All that you will need to do is turn the tap on, pull the diverow bg-white pad-tb-15r switch and water will
          rather
          flow through your shower head.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">
          <strong>Thermostatic showers</strong> can provide you with a high level of control over temperature. It is
          akin to a manual
          mixer shower, and takes water from an existing water supply. However, unlike the normal mixer unit, it
          combines
          a pre-set thermostat to keep water temperature consistent. Thermostatic showers can be deck mounted for use in
          a shower bath or work as a part of a covered or exposed unit.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">A
          <strong>power mixer</strong> is similar to a normal mixer shower. Many people utilise an additional booster
          pump in order
          to create high pressure from the shower. They are known as â€˜power showersâ€™.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">
          <strong>Electric showers</strong> are widely used in homes where there is a shortage of hot water created by a
          boiler.
          In contrast to mixer and power showers, electric showers draw water from cold water supply, where it is heated
          using heating elements within the shower unit.
        </li>
        <li class="f-size-12">
          <strong>Digital showers</strong> are the latest types of showers. They work in a manner similar to mixers or
          power showers,
          but they provide you with greater control over temperature. These showers are suitable for use in modern as
          well
          as traditional homes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4 class="mar-top">Sinks</h4>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">
        <em>Size is one of the major factors which you will need to take into consideration while looking for a kitchen
          sink
        </em>. A single, deep basin will help you wash large parts or remove food residues. However, you may find it

        ensure
        that you acquire the right size drain, or check the instructions of the manufacturer since they come with the
        sink

        <em>the drain should also match with the faucet and sink</em>. In fact, a drain with a different material or
        finish works
        well with sink or accent.
        <strong>Brass drains</strong> are the most widely used sink drains because of their looks and durability.
        <strong>Bathroom sink drains</strong> are available with or without overflows.</p>

        <strong>Sinks - </strong>
        <em>Bathroom sinks are often more dirty than kitchen sinks
        </em>. Though sinks are used for flow of all food traffic, they have disposals and in-built bacteria to break
        them
        down. Therefore, clean it thoroughly once in a month. Scrub it off, soak it in vinegar and then wash it with
        drain
        water. This process will help in removing mold and gunk which can be built in there without a proper cleaning.

        bay areas which allow liquids to drain away.
        <em>Buildings which are not connected to a municipal sewer system normally make use of an on-site wastewater
          treatment
          such as septic system, drain field or dry well
        </em>. Once wastewater gets collected in the separator, petroleum products including fluids and oils float at
        the
        top and heavier materials such as sand and sludge at the bottom. This isolates petroleum products from
        wastewater,
        which gets discharged between top and bottom layers before sewering. In case the separator isnâ€™t installed,
        petroleum
        products might accumulate within the sewer system. This can cause high concentration of explosive vapors on
        manholes
        or sewer lines or petroleum wastes or other solids plugging the sewer.</p>
      <p class="f-size-13 lh-22">Discharging a large amount of oil or solvent wastes into the sewer might interfere with
        sewer line maintenance, proper
        functioning and safety of wastewater treatment plants. The permitted discharges are highly regulated by sewer
        authorities.
        Sludges that get accumulated in the separators can contain organic contaminants &amp; heavy metals, which are
        regarded
        as hazardous waste. In order to reduce and check issues with separators, you need to ensure periodic inspection
        and
        maintenance. You may face a challenge in renovated buildings. Separators sometimes a clean-out service and
